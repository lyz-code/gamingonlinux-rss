      <title>Valve just gave away another bunch of Steam Decks so check your email</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>During The Game Awards 2022, Valve were giving away a Steam Deck every minute and it seems they loved throwing hardware at people so much they just did it again.</p>
<p>As the show aired on Steam, below the video (if you didn't have it full screen), it was showing the usernames people set. This — caused some hilarity, with a certain "Milf Hunter" becoming the source of much amusement during the event. No doubt <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1601023351262150656" target="_blank">this image</a> and memory will reach some sort of legendary status among Steam users. Where were you when Valve announced Milf Hunter won a Steam Deck on their store huh?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5376521241671150787gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Anyway, the official OnDeck Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1603547367747497984" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! The team was so blown away by the overwhelming response to the <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/" target="_blank">@thegameawards</a> event that we've decided to give away another round of Steam Decks! We just drew 171 more names from all the registrants who tuned in (over 980,000 of you!). Check your email to see if you won!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you might want to have a quick look to see if you just got a shiny present from Valve.</p>

      <title>Immortals Fenyx Rising now on Steam but quite messy on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Immortals Fenyx Rising is another from Ubisoft as they continue putting their games back on Steam, and sadly this release seems a bit messy on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there's no annoying launcher issues here. While it does have Ubisoft Connect, much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/assassins-creed-valhalla-is-impressive-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Assassins Creed Valhalla</a>, it worked out of the box. Although sometimes the Ubisoft Connect pop-up wouldn't go away, needing SHIFT+F2 set in Steam Input to load the overlay and disable notifications from it completely. The overlay itself also doesn't go away when you load it, so you need to then restart if it happens.</p>
<p>Sadly, there's a number of issues with the actual game directly. Firstly, they didn't even give it a controller configuration. So before starting, you need to go into Steam Input and set it to a gamepad as it defaults to mouse and keyboard. After that, you then get greeted by an intro cut-scene that will either have completely broken audio or go repeatedly badly out of sync. The audio issues persist in the game itself directly too. Side-note: even on desktop Linux the audio issues happen too.</p>
<p>Another problem is the grass rendering, it has a load of black line flickering across multiple testing graphics configurations. So right now, it's not something I'm going to suggest anyone pick up.</p>

      <title>Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translator VKD3D-Proton version 2.8 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve and their open source contractors sure are a busy bunch. VKD3D-Proton, which translates Direct3D 12 to Vulkan <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.8" target="_blank">version 2.8</a> is out now.</p>
<p>An exciting sounding improvement for lowering the CPU overhead is the addition of support for the VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer extension. On Steam Deck "most of it" was already used but now this release will allow for others to benefit too. With a note that "GPU bound performance increases slightly".</p>
<p>Two new extensions are now required but both should be readily available in drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>VK_KHR_buffer_device_address</li>
<li>VK_KHR_push_descriptor</li>
</ul>
<p>They have also rewritten support for host accessible images, no longer needing a bunch of per-application hacks and workarounds with Guardians of the Galaxy "finally" able to run well on NVIDIA.</p>
<p>On top of that there's a rewritten swap chain, which should be transparent to users but has many benefits like more precise latency control and frame pacing, reduced CPU overhead, fixes a hang in Hitman III and allows for native Linux use of VKD3D-Proton too.</p>
<p>Plus there's also various fixes and specific workarounds for titles like: Spiderman Miles Morales, Borderlands 3, Age of Empires IV, Resident Evil Village, Witcher 3, Gears 5 and some more minor D3D12 features were added.</p>

      <title>Xfce 4.18 desktop is finally here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just shy of two years since Xfce 4.16 the latest release has landed with Xfce 4.18 that comes with tons of new features and a "gazillion" bug fixes. It's still one of the most popular desktop environments for Linux, that offers up a lightweight experience without a lot of the fancy shiny stuff found in GNOME and KDE.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5390436941671126806gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5390436941671126806gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A lot of this release went into the Thunar file manager, some of the improvements noted include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image preview in the file manager, with two different modes available. You can have the preview pop over the left panel, or have it so its own panel appears on the right.</li>
<li>Undo and Redo support for various file operations like moving, renaming, sending to trash.</li>
<li>File highlighting accent colour support. You can adjust the background and filename to different colours.</li>
<li>A customizable toolbar.</li>
<li>A new split view.</li>
<li>Recursive searching.</li>
<li>A new Recent file view.</li>
<li>Bookmarks moved to their own menu.</li>
<li>+ more</li>
</ul>
<p>There's plenty of improvement elsewhere like the Application Finder having support for systems with hybrid graphics, the compositor now supports adaptive vsync with GLX, better support for UI scaling, you can now decide what to do when a new display is connected and much much more.</p>
<p>More can be seen on a developer <a href="https://alexxcons.github.io/blogpost_8.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> and full <a href="https://www.xfce.org/download/changelogs/4.18/" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>

      <title>We may get a Steam Controller 2, plus fun updates coming to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022" target="_blank">The Verge</a> managed to speak to a couple of developers at Valve on the Steam Deck, and while most of it was already known and largely covered here on GOL already (go through our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck tag</a>) there's a couple of interesting bits to pick out. ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/valve-steam-deck-home-run/" target="_blank">see my end of year Steam Deck article</a>.</p>
<p><em>It's quite a nice read overall and a very good article from Sean Hollister, especially for people not constantly reading up on everything Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>One of the first points is that Valve said the Steam Deck may never be "Stable" in the way that traditional consoles are, since Valve are "always going to be pushing updates as long as there’s people playing". So expect them to keep on pushing out new features and new fixes for bugs as they come in. Any regular Steam user will know: Valve like to keep on iterating on things constantly, and their Beta branch for the Steam client likes to break things quite often.</p>
<p>While it's not out yet, Valve are still working towards a SteamOS 3 release for everyone, and Valve are "excited to see other manufacturers making their own handheld PC gaming devices, we’re excited to see people make their own SteamOS machines which could include small PCs that they put next to their TV".</p>
<p>A Steam Controller 2 is something I've been asking for <em>years</em>, I even wrote a bit about the original in 2019 about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/06/confessing-my-continued-love-of-the-steam-controller-a-few-years-after-release/" target="_blank">how much I loved it</a>, and Valve want to see a second happen too, they said "we want to make it happen" but naturally they're heavily focused on the Deck directly right now.</p>
<p>Another feature Valve are working on is a built-in audio mixer for the Gaming Mode UI, so you can easily adjust levels between different applications, games and friends chat to make it all easier. No doubt this will be leveraging the newer Pipewire audio stack that makes this sort of thing easier than ever on Linux.</p>
<p>Something people have been asking for, a lot, is being able to share performance profiles. Valve are also looking into that. They don't plan to let you share graphics settings, but a profile of the options you change in the Quick Access performance menu sounds likely.</p>
<p>Finally, while they've repeatedly confirmed a Steam Deck 2 is planned, it doesn't seem like a "Pro" model will come as they like the idea of keeping everything at a set configuration for performance to make it easier for everyone and plan to keep that a while longer until it will really make a difference.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix from Valve gets The Witcher 3 next-gen DX12 working on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, that certainly didn't take long did it? Valve have already put up an update to Proton Hotfix, that works around the crashing issue in DirectX 12 in The Witcher 3 next-gen on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Now it will work out of the box without the need for any workarounds. You can simply uncheck any forced compatibility option you had set on it, as Valve set it to Proton Hotfix by default now for the Steam Deck. You can also install Proton Hotfix yourself in your Steam Library, and set it on the game manually in the compatibility menu if you have any issues.</p>
<p><em>Just imagine if CD Projekt gave Valve a bit of early notice and testing on this, it could've worked right away.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="m-msjdUyGl0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/558f3d11ce6e28ccada232baa2ae1d32.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/m-msjdUyGl0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's still numerous issues with the new update though across all platforms, with masses of complaints about it. CD Projekt have <a href="https://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1603046409619513345" target="_blank">announced</a> that they're looking into it. Hopefully it won't be too long before it gets properly stable once again. Nice that it was a free update but they really need to do some more QA testing before pushing things out.</p>

      <title>Valve hit a home run with the first year of Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What an absolutely exceptional first year Valve had with the Steam Deck, and it continues to be my main way to play games now. From playing lots of indie games, to plenty of AA / AAA that work surprisingly well on it even right at release, the Steam Deck has opened up PC gaming to many new ways to play.</p>
<p>How far it has come since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">the original release</a> huh? Valve's original release date in December last year was clearly overly optimistic, and in a lot of ways the February release this year was too. Supplies were constantly an issue and people were waiting months for a possible purchase email to come from Valve for their reservation, whereas now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">you can get it in 1-2 weeks</a> with no reservation needed. There's even the official <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/thoughts-on-the-official-steam-deck-docking-station/" target="_blank">Steam Deck Docking Station</a> to use it on your big TV (and many other cheaper docks too). We also found out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">it shipped over a million</a> back in October.</p>
<p>Currently, at time of writing, Deck Verified is doing pretty great on the numbers too. Looking at the stats on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which also includes unlisted games (but you still have access to them) there's now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified - 2651</li>
<li>Playable - 4286</li>
<li>Unsupported - 2431</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's not forget though, the vast majority of games on Steam Deck weren't even designed for it. Most still don't have even a single change done to make it work on it, or work any better. Valve clearly had a plan when they released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, the Windows translation layer based on Wine, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/08/valve-officially-confirm-a-new-version-of-steam-play-which-includes-a-modified-version-of-wine/" target="_blank">back in 2018</a>. Without Proton, the Steam Deck would have been pretty much dead on arrival like the original Steam Machines were. You don't pull people in without the games they want to play, and for the most part, Proton has solved that problem. Whoever at Valve actually made the decision to push forward with Proton is clearly a genius.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Steam Deck using Linux, it has successfully continued to push up the Linux user statistics on Steam too overall. It's hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/novembers-steam-survey-shows-another-uptick-for-linux-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">multiple all-time new-highs</a> of Linux users, and while the majority pushing those numbers up are from SteamOS Linux on the Steam Deck, the numbers of desktop Linux users on it are going up too.</p>
<p>It's hard to think of a gaming hardware release that's felt this fresh and exciting, and I've been through quite a lot of launches myself over the years including being an early adopter of the PS3, PS4, Switch, XBX and many other earlier systems. The Steam Deck is just different.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the KDE Plasma desktop mode was a fantastic touch too of course, ensuring that out of the box the Steam Deck could function as a full PC. This also enables tons of extras to be installed and allows you to work around all sorts of things you can't do in the Steam Deck Gaming Mode UI, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-desktop-mode-plus-other-stores-like-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank">my second article</a> at the original release that went along with my main review talking about the likes of Discord and the Epic Games Store (although I would recommend the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/heroic-games-launcher-v250-is-out-with-downloads-manager-app-sideloading/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> for Epic / GOG now). It has limits due to the locked down file-system (that you can unlock at your own peril) but for the most part, it works great. So great in fact, that the likes of <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-gaming-2022-review-vampire-survivor-1849892099" target="_blank">Kotaku</a> <em>forgot</em> the original Steam Machines ever had a desktop mode (it used GNOME instead of KDE).</p>
<p>With a vibrant community building up around it, there's clearly no stopping it at this point. People are creating all sorts of things for it, like the excellent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" target="_blank">Deckmate attachment system</a>. There's also multiple software plugin systems like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/decky-loader-for-steam-deck-plugin-loader-gets-fixed-up-for-newer-steamos/" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a>, and remember all the hype over boot videos? Not many vendors allow such wild customisation and even end up making it easier for you. Love emulation? There's now dedicated launchers for that too like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/emudeck-20-makes-emulation-on-steam-deck-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank">EmuDeck</a> that brings them all under one roof.</p>
<p>While there's a lot of positives, it's not perfection and I do have a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/my-current-little-wish-list-for-steam-deck-upgrades/" target="_blank">wishlist of items</a> I hope Valve look into that I put up in October. I also won't sugarcoat that there's numerous other issues. There's constant problems with game launchers like the EA App breaking completely, then Valve fixed it loading and then it needed another fix because updates were breaking it. Some popular games stop working completely with new updates too. Anti-cheat is another ongoing issue, although largely out of Valve's hands as developers need to support it directly (Hi Bungie). Deck Verified is also a weird one too, with games sneaking into Verified that actually don't work well, which brings up constant questions on how they're testing them, and Unsupported games that actually are flawless. Valve ended up putting in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/looks-like-valve-are-adding-a-feedback-system-for-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">feedback system</a> to hopefully point them towards titles with problems.</p>
<p>Overall though: I can't wait to see what Valve are cooking up in 2023 for Steam Deck. I plan to keep putting a ton of hours into it, including streaming games from my PC it can't handle (now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/valve-has-finally-fixed-the-steam-remote-play-audio-loss-bug-on-linux/" target="_blank">Remote Play is finally fixed for Linux hosts</a>) while comfortably curled up on my sofa to get away from the chains of my desk.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck is the most accessible and affordable all-rounder handheld gaming PC, and I sure do hope there's a lot more to come from it. Now I just need a Steam Controller 2 (please Valve), and eventually a Steam Deck 2 that's a little lighter and has a better battery along with the next-generation AMD APU and it'll be another guaranteed home run. I'm not asking for much right? We <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/valve-teams-with-komodo-to-bring-the-steam-deck-to-asia/" target="_blank">still have Asia</a> to go for the Steam Deck yet, so plenty more to come.</p>
<p>Be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">follow GamingOnLinux on YouTube</a> where I do lots of Steam Deck content.</p>
<p><em>What do you think of the first year of the Steam Deck?</em></p>

      <title>Epic Games are killing off a bunch of classics like Unreal Tournament</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-is-turning-off-online-services-and-servers-for-some-older-games" target="_blank">announced</a> today they're killing off a bunch of classic games removing them from stores and turning off their online services for retro delights like Unreal Tournament.</p>
<p>Why are they doing this? They're consolidating their services directly into their modern all-in-one Epic Online Services, so they don't want anything not using that to stick around that they have to maintain.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of titles being removed from stores (some are already gone like Unreal Tournament), and having their online play turned off on January 24 - 2023:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1000 Tiny Claws</li>
<li>Dance Central 1-3 
<ul>
<li>Note: Dance Central VR online multiplayer will remain available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Green Day: Rock Band</li>
<li>Monsters (Probably) Stole My Princess</li>
<li>Rock Band 1-3 
<ul>
<li>Note: Rock Band 4 online multiplayer will remain available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Beatles: Rock Band</li>
<li>Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars</li>
<li>Unreal Gold</li>
<li>Unreal II: The Awakening</li>
<li>Unreal Tournament 2003</li>
<li>Unreal Tournament 2004</li>
<li>Unreal Tournament 3
<ul>
<li>Note: We have plans to bring back online features via Epic Online Services in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully the community (like perhaps <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches" target="_blank">OldUnreal</a>), will find a way to get online going again for some of the classic Unreal Tournament games. Otherwise, that's a whole lot of FPS history being lost.</p>
<p>For Unreal Tournament 3, it looks like they're re-branding it as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/13210/Unreal_Tournament_3_X/" target="_blank">Unreal Tournament 3 X</a> and making it free to play, as you can see they already did it on the Steam page and you can see all the changes on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/13210/history/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> history but it's not actually live they're just re-purposing the Steam page.</p>
<p>On top of that they also said they're removing Linux and macOS versions of Hatoful Boyfriend and Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star today. No reason given for either.</p>
<p>If you do want to stock up, the old Unreal games are still on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?query=unreal&amp;order=desc:score" target="_blank">GOG</a> but probably won't be for long.</p>

<li>[Linux/macOS] Added support for DXVK Limit FPS option.</li>
<li>[macOS] A DMG for ARM64 for M1/M2 is now available to download on Github. (if a message of app being damaged shows up, run this command on the terminal: <code class="inline-code">sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine | mdfind kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier = "*heroic"</code></li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixes</p>
<ul>

<li>Fix tray icon not properly updating the list of recent games</li>
<li>Fix stuck GOG save games input</li>
<li>[Linux/macOS] Fixed DXVK Installation</li>

<p>If you're on Steam Deck, be sure to jump into desktop mode and fire up Discover to get the updates. On desktop Linux, you likely know what to do!</p>

      <title>Steam with Linux now available in Tesla cars (Beta)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here come a bunch more gamers using Linux, as Tesla have rolled out a software update that enables Steam in Beta.</p>
<p>Announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1602789357156536321" target="_blank">Twitter</a> with a video to show it off, you get access to many thousands of games. This is largely thanks to all the Linux work Valve has been doing through the Steam client, graphics drivers, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> and more. Accessing Steam has been enabled on Model S &amp; X (2022+) and requires "Premium Connectivity". From the <a href="https://teslascope.com/teslapedia/software/2022.44.25.1" target="_blank">changelog</a>, it mentions specifically people can play anything that is Steam Deck Verified, although it's not clear if they're blocking games that aren't from working. So, it's basically a really expensive Steam Deck with wheels now.</p>
<p>Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais also put up a <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1602826674957332480/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a> post on it, showing off a nice clear picture too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12398269471671021348gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12398269471671021348gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Image Credit - Pierre-Loup Griffais on Twitter.</em></p>
<p>Previously, Tesla got <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21023-9605.PDF" target="_blank">investigated</a> for the Passenger Play feature as the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration thought it would cause a distraction and was a safety issue. To counter it, Tesla disabled it while the vehicle is moving.</p>

      <title>Valve fix the New Big Picture Mode on NVIDIA for Linux gamers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3627116953544957770" target="_blank">the latest</a> Steam Client Beta for Desktop released December 13th, Valve has now fixed the New Big Picture Mode not working for those with NVIDIA GPUs along with plenty of other fixes.</p>
<p>Previously, it would try to launch and get stuck and not actually display anything but you would hear the intro video playing. Now it seems to launch just fine, although it feels a little sluggish overall with all the animations and fading effects that it does. Still, nice to have it actually work now though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12153459871671018367gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12153459871671018367gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They also still haven't yet fixed the issue of it showing what's behind the window when you bring up the Steam menu</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20068066251671018463gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20068066251671018463gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's all the changes noted by Valve:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several issues related to popup dialogs being sized incorrectly</li>
<li>Fixed issue where game hover UI would sometimes get stuck in the upper left corner of the UI</li>
<li>Fixed sizing of app details DLC hover</li>
<li>Fixed regression where clicking on DLC &amp; "view all" in the dlc rollup not navigate to the store</li>
<li>Fixed "Move" and "Uninstall" not working in content management UI.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where a browser opened by a game was sticking around after closing the overlay</li>
<li>Fixed launch options dialog not closing when cancelling game launch</li>
<li>Various fixes to make the UI scale better in higher resolutions</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the virtual keyboard would continuously be made visible after exiting a game</li>
<li>Added option to start in windowed mode under Settings =&gt; Display =&gt; Big Picture Mode =&gt; Windowed</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Added direct navigation to controller inputs and modes from the preview screen</li>

      <title>Steam Deck OS 3.4 gets a Death Stranding fix, plus new Client Beta and Firmware update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Three different bits of news to cover for Steam Deck updates today, as Valve pushed out three different upgrades. Here's all that's new.</p>
<p>Firstly, for players of Death Stranding Director's Cut, Valve has put out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3637250052887652007" target="_blank">fix</a> into SteamOS 3.4 Preview to work around it crashing when you move the right thumbstick on the map to tilt it. Always nice to see Valve fix up things <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/death-stranding-directors-cut-has-an-annoying-issue-that-can-reboot-your-steam-deck/" target="_blank">I highlighted previously</a>.</p>
<p>The next one is an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3637250052890759226" target="_blank">update</a> for the Stable version of the Steam Deck OS (SteamOS 3.3.3), which has a "hotfix to enable compatibility with future input firmware". You'll see an update but there's no user-visible changes included right now.</p>
<p>Finally the Steam Deck Client Beta was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3605725422746687645" target="_blank">updated</a> for December 13th to include these changes:</p>

<p>The massive free next-gen <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/292030/view/3642879552277333733" target="_blank">update</a> for The Witcher 3 is here, and out of the box now on Steam Deck it will just crash when you try to load into the game. Here's how to sort it out.</p>
<p><em>Thankfully, it's actually quite easy.</em></p>
<p>Currently the problem seems to be all the updates to the DirectX 12 mode, it will just crash to an error screen after loading and it will do this every time.</p>
<p>To get around that in the new update: in the launcher, next to the play button is a drop-down box where you can select DirectX 11 and that will get it working again. Another option for those that want it, is in the game Properties -&gt; Betas, you can select the Classic option to get the pre-patch version of the game. You can select that Beta even before you download it, so you don't end up wasting time with an extra download too.</p>

      <title>Wine on Wayland sounds like it&#39;s coming along nicely</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Collabora have given an <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/wine-on-wayland-2022-updatye-more-games-more-apps-more-fun.html" target="_blank">end of year update</a> on how the work towards running the Windows compatibility layer on Wayland is coming along and it sounds good.</p>
<p>Their focus has been to keep up with upstream Wine development, which involved "splitting the driver into a PE and Unix part, updating it for the latest internal driver APIs, and making preparations to support WoW64". A big improvement is that it now supports cross-process rendering, something required for Chromium/CEF applications. On top of that they've also worked on improved support for the linux-dmabuf v4 Wayland protocol (aka dmabuf-feedback), that "allows compositors to dynamically send information about optimal formats and modifiers, e.g., depending on the surface presentation mode (fullscreen vs windowed)" plus many other ehancements.</p>
<p>On the Wine Development <a href="https://www.winehq.org/mailman3/hyperkitty/list/wine-devel@winehq.org/thread/5GQWFP7MC6GQTL2KLAV6F6RUMOE3QULI/" target="_blank">mailing list</a>, developer Alexandros Frantzis also touched on when to expect the code in upstream Wine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year, due to the extensive ongoing internal rework in Wine (e.g., win32u), the decision was made to postpone the upstreaming of the Wayland driver until some amount of internal stability had been reached. My impression is that things are a lot more stable now, from the drivers' point of view at least. Is there any upcoming work that people feel would be severely hindered by the upstreaming of the Wayland driver?</p>
<p>Ideally, I would like to start the upstreaming effort (which I expect will take some time) at some point early next year, after the codebase has been unfrozen. Does this sound reasonable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also provided a video to show off the latest work that shows:  Chrome with accelerated cross-process rendering, LibreOffice, Call of Duty 2 (Demo), Crayon Physics Deluxe, Dagon, Factorio, The Last Express and Phoning Home.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lZ-MK72Kyp8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e85fb7de59a5ee2595b40fab75689758.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lZ-MK72Kyp8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Why is this important? It's because Wayland is gradually replacing X11, and having Wine run on it natively without another compatibility layer in between like XWayland will hopefully improve performance and reduce another layer of complexities to go through for both users and developers.</p>

      <title>AMD Radeon RX 7000 launched today for the select few able to beat the crowds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD has today released the Radeon RX 7000 series GPUs starting with the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and Radeon RX 7900 XT.</p>
<p>Stock was, as expected, very limited. I won't go over every single bit again, which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/amd-announce-rx-7900-xtx-and-rx-7900-xt-plus-fsr3-teased/" target="_blank">covered previously</a> but to reiterate some of what to expect from these cards:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>AMD RDNA 3 Architecture</strong> – Featuring an advanced chiplet design, rearchitected compute units and second-generation AMD Infinity Cache technology, RDNA 3 architecture delivers up to 54% more performance per watt than RDNA 2.</li>
<li><strong>Chiplet Design</strong> – The world’s first gaming GPU with a chiplet design delivers up to 15% higher frequencies at up to 54% better power efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Generational Uplift – </strong>The flagship AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX delivers considerably higher 4K performance than the Radeon RX 6950 XT.</li>
<li><strong>DisplayPort 2.1 Support –</strong> The industry’s only high-end gaming graphics cards to support DisplayPort 2.1 technology with UHBR 13.5, enabling high-refresh 4K (up to 480Hz) or 8K (up to 165Hz) gaming on next-gen displays.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by some Linux benchmarks <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/rx7900xt-rx7900xtx-linux" target="_blank">Phoronix</a> did, it seems like a pretty nice set of cards. Although, they didn't have the NVIDIA 4000 series to test against, but at least it shows AMD is a clear winner against even the 3090, which is good news for me as I have an NVIDIA 2080 Ti and I was lucky enough to beat the crowds at Overclockers to bag a Radeon RX 7900 XTX as a personal purchase (I rarely get sent any hardware). <strong>Update</strong>: correction, no 7900 XTX for me as <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1603073266364579842" target="_blank">Overclockers UK over-sold on it</a>.</p>
<p>You can find some other reviews by the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq6Yp2Zxnkk" target="_blank">JayzTwoCents</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBJ-vo6Ri9c" target="_blank">LinusTT</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UFiG7CwpHk" target="_blank">Hardware Unboxed</a>.</p>
<p>Want to find where to possibly by one when they're back in stock? Check the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/where-to-buy/radeon-rx-graphics" target="_blank">AMD website</a>, although they weirdly don't list the UK, apparently we no longer exist. For people in the UK you can try the likes of <a href="https://www.scan.co.uk/search?q=Radeon+RX+7900+XTX" target="_blank">Scan</a>, <a href="https://www.ebuyer.com/search?q=Radeon+RX+7900+XTX" target="_blank">Ebuyer</a>, <a href="https://www.overclockers.co.uk/?query=Radeon%2520RX%25207900%2520XTX" target="_blank">Overclockers</a>.</p>
<p>For me it's especially exciting, as I haven't had an AMD card for a good 10+ years so it's going to be a whole different world. I'm looking forward to seeing what open source graphics drivers can do.</p>

      <title>Valve has finally fixed the Steam Remote Play audio loss bug on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally, after years of waiting, Valve has now fixed the Steam Remote Play bug that basically made the feature useless for a Linux host.</p>
<p>Steam Remote Play is a great feature, allowing you to stream your Steam Library from a powerful PC to something smaller like a Steam Deck or anything that can run Steam Link. Especially nice for games the Steam Deck can't run directly, if you have the hardware elsewhere streaming it is a good solution to let you relax on the sofa or in bed with it.</p>
<p>The problem is that since 2019 there's been <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/6749" target="_blank">a bug</a> where after a while, like clockwork, every single time the audio would crackle and then just vanish completely on the system receiving the stream. This bug caused me to seriously consider sitting at my PC one evening recently, just to continue my Death Stranding Director's Cut play-through which runs poorly for me across two different Steam Decks (even with multiple "fixes" tested).</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3627116953542043543" target="_blank">Steam Client Beta</a> for December 12th has now <u>solved</u> this! I cannot even begin to tell you how happy I am about this. I much prefer chilling on my sofa in the evening with a Steam Deck, so this pleases me.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for switching the primary monitor on Windows. See Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Preferred Display.</li>
<li>Fixed overlay scaling when resizing game window</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the Armor-X Pro gamepad in PS4 mode</li>
<li>Fixed long delay at startup when the Razer Huntsman Elite keyboard is plugged in</li>
<li>Fixed the Logitech G29 controller showing up as a gamepad instead of a wheel</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed eventual audio crackling and loss when streaming from Linux</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash when taking screenshots through the overlay</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NnisYGZv9QY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/181aa8cd8e1b2c2718e45aa6595ad78c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NnisYGZv9QY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Now they just need to fix up the New Big Picture Mode being completely <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/8916" target="_blank">broken</a> on NVIDIA and I'll have even less to moan about.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive v0.6 out with a day and night cycle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive just continues to impress. It's a free and open source evolution sim built with Godot Engine and version 0.6 is out now with big new helpful features.</p>
<p>One of the most immediately visible changes is the day and night cycle, so the game as a whole feels a lot more alive in a way. Although it's disabled by default, as it can make it more difficult. There's also now a Thriveopedia, giving you an easy way in-game to read up on all things Thrive. Fossilization is in allowing players to save species in a museum that can be viewed in the Thriveopedia too. Om top of that they also rewrote their launcher to provide "enhanced processing and loading speeds, a sleeker design, and greater versatility".</p>
<p>More:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Thrive now has a new intro video when you start the game. Make sure you have it enabled in the settings so you can appreciate the exciting view!</li>
<li>The main menu now features social media icons so that you can easily find a community outlet of your choice.</li>
<li>Thrive now has a safe-mode triggered crashing, which disables all mods and video playing before restarting.</li>
<li>Pili now feature a slight damage delay, preventing them from rapidly inflicting a large amount of damage at once.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Core Devourer is another for fans of Vampire Survivors and Soulstone Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love over-the top repeatable action horde games like Soulstone Survivors, Vampire Survivors and all the others? You'll never guess what, another developer is making one that sounds and looks quite good.</p>
<p>Core Devourer is the name and it's a "sci-fi action-packed roguelite where you hunt down huge hordes of droids and absorb their cores to become the strongest cybernetic being on the planet". The developer emailed it over, and mentioned it's coming to Linux. The boss fights in this one could be fun, as the developer said they each have a unique pattern to learn and overcome, that's on top of the many hordes you're blasting away too.</p>
<p>You can see their first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Wm_6xgth2KE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c2a62a4fb8c268e570634f77f807f6e5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Wm_6xgth2KE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>10+ weapons with special effects.</li>
<li>7+ procedural maps to explore.</li>
<li>Hundreds of unique power-ups for your character.</li>
<li>Many character upgrades.</li>
<li>Craftable gear.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full game is due to launch sometime in Q2 2023.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2199060/Core_Devourer/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The rather great LEGO Bricktales switches to Vulkan on Linux, adds UI scaling options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LEGO Bricktales was already a lot of fun and now perhaps it's even better with some new options and improvements for their Native Linux version too.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1898290/view/3615857706245766322" target="_blank">update</a> went out on December 5th, it should enable it to be even smoother on Linux and thanks to the new UI scaling options, it should work better for people who need things a little big bigger — something I truly wish every modern game release had but for some reason some developers just don't even think about it.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added UI scaling options.</li>
<li>Reworked UI for build mode.</li>
<li>Tutorial improvements.</li>
<li>Bricks can be nudged horizontally with arrow keys on keyboard when selected.</li>
<li>Added achievements button to main menu.</li>
<li>Improved mix of two City music tracks (removed troublesome frequencies).</li>
<li>Set Vulkan as default graphics API on Linux.</li>
<li>Minor diorama changes that ensure playability when players use the "Help, I'm stuck" teleport feature.</li>
<li>Improved controls for touch devices.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Plus a few bug fixes I won't note here due to spoilers.</em></p>

      <title>Valve improves the Steam Store on Steam Deck, plus more bug fixes in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two updates for the Steam Deck today as Valve has not only put out another Steam Deck Client Beta, they're also finally trying to make the actual Steam store better on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For the store, there's been so many issues I've lost count. From losing where you are, to various bits of it just not working right and browsing Steam on it has been a nuisance.</p>
<p>Valve has now done some work to resolve these issues server-side, meaning no download needed. On <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1602470806709493760" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, they said: "Hello! We’ve just shipped a quality of life update to the Store experience on Steam Deck (mostly around focus and navigation). This is a server side update, so you won’t need to do a software update to see these improvements. </p>
<p>Thanks for all your feedback and keep it coming!"</p>
<p>Additionally, here's what's in the December 12 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3637250052888201563" target="_blank">Steam Deck Client Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed keyboard re-opening incorrectly on game exit</li>

      <title>Chained Echoes is as close as you can get to retro-styled RPG perfection</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I am rarely this enthusiastic about games, especially retro-styled games because so many miss the mark in numerous ways but thankfully Chained Echoes is just brilliant.</p>
<p>"Chained Echoes is a story-driven JRPG where a group of heroes travel around the vast continent of Valandis to bring an end to the war between its three kingdoms. In the course of their journey, they will travel through a wide array of diverse landscapes spanning from wind-tanned plateaus and exotic archipelagos to sunken cities and forgotten dungeons."</p>
<p>Funded on Kickstarter back in 2019, it's out now along with the Native Linux version and as far as I can tell, it's awesome. It performs great, it looks bright and inviting with an art style that truly makes my eyes glow and the music as well — everything in this comes together so nicely. From the first few moments in the game, I knew I was going to love it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3964507121670872248gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3964507121670872248gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Honestly, not only is this shaping up to be one of my favourite games of the year, it has the makings to be eventually classed as a true classic in its own right.</p>
<p>Modern features and retro styles fused together in a way that makes me want to keep coming back for more. It has good pacing, you can pretty much save wherever you want and the battles are a lot of fun too with multiple mechanics that makes them interesting. From the various abilities you get, to the overdrive system that has you plan your moves to stay inside the green bar and not overheat your team — and failure isn't annoying here, just try the battle again and you heal between battles. What joy.</p>
<p>Here's some Steam Deck footage, spoilers within:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ir0Rr_64S6A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/953adbf2cb4354ea895526b008e42584.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ir0Rr_64S6A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>30 - 40 hours of play time.</li>
<li>Fast paced turn-based battles.</li>
<li>No random encounters; enemies can be seen running around.</li>
<li>Tons of items to be looted, stolen or crafted.</li>
<li>Complex skill and equipment system.</li>
<li>Customize your own airship.</li>
<li>Travel and fight by foot or in your Mech.</li>
<li>16-bit SNES style graphics.</li>
<li>Music inspired by PSX RPGs.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Last of Us Part I on Steam Deck gets support from Valve and Naughty Dog Co-President</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like the upcoming Steam release of The Last of Us Part I should work well on Steam Deck, as not only are Valve already teasing it, the Co-President of developer Naughty Dog talked about it too.</p>
<p>On the Valve side, a keen eye might spot a short clip of it on the official Steam Deck <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/" target="_blank">website</a>. Look for a friendly Giraffe, but to help you along it's here:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9123578921670851868gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9123578921670851868gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Showing it off like that, even just as a brief teaser shows Valve clearly have confidence in it which makes me happy. It's still to this day one of my favourite single-player story experiences. If you missed the Steam release announcement, I noted it in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/lots-of-good-stuff-announced-at-the-game-awards-2022-m-roundup/" target="_blank">The Game Awards 2022 round-up</a> and there's a lot of good stuff coming.</p>
<p>On top of that, Neil Druckmann the Co-President of Naughty Dog said on <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1601694903724953600" target="_blank">Twitter</a> "Ellie and Joel will grace the Steam Deck… don’t worry!". Sounds like it's a first-party port for Windows too (the Steam Deck runs it through <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>), with Naughty Dog doing it directly.</p>
<p>Exciting times!</p>

      <title>Crawl Tactics blends roguelikes with a tactical RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From South Korean developer icefill comes Crawl Tactics, a new turn-based game that blends together elements of a roguelike and a tactical RPG into something unique. You've no doubt played a few of these smaller tactical RPGs and various strategy games, so it may look a bit familiar on the surface.</p>
<p>Here you manage a party of adventurers and use the environment to your advantage to conquer the dungeon. Here though, both the battles and dungeons are procedurally generated so it's different each time. There's multiple types of dungeon biomes and some rooms might even be friendly.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MFIYAUxJIe4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c765f3a12c664678de0a1eb6222a9f9b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MFIYAUxJIe4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>More of a fully fledged Tactical RPG battle than a puzzle game!
<ul>
<li>Turn-based tactical battles, pitting the team you built against groups of vicious enemies.</li>
<li>Various skills and classes to customize your party.</li>
<li>Deadly weapons and items.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explore a different dungeon every time!
<ul>
<li>Battlefields and dungeons are procedurally generated.</li>
<li>Various dungeon habitats. From forests to caverns and ruins to catacombs.</li>
<li>Some rooms are filled with peril, and others with helpful NPCs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Powerful magic and skills!</li>
<li>Use the environment!
<ul>
<li>Traps and hazards can be exploited by both you and your adversaries; take cover behind barrels or zap pools of water.</li>

      <title>The Garden Path a &#39;slice-of-life sim&#39; gets a new trailer and release window</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love more casual games? The "slice-of-life sim" named The Garden Path is getting closer and a new trailer is up.</p>
<p>A game that's all about taking things slow. As you "explore the quiet moments of a life well lived, where your garden will grow to reflect both the passing of time and your own design", something that people who prefer less action and a little more tranquil exploration and discovery. Time passes by even when you're not in it, so you can close it and return another day to do more.</p>
<p>Sadly, it's still a good while away as they're saying it's coming in "Spring 2023". In the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1638500/view/3633871651334435767" target="_blank">announcement</a>, they mentioned all the feedback they've been getting through the Demos and Betas so they needed a little extra time to just get it ready for release.</p>

      <title>Microsoft&#39;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard hits a bump as FTC seeks to block it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the big news back in January that Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank">was acquiring Activision Blizzard</a>? Well, the FTC aren't happy about it and are trying to block it.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/12/ftc-seeks-block-microsoft-corps-acquisition-activision-blizzard-inc" target="_blank">statement</a> the FTC said "The Federal Trade Commission is seeking to block technology giant Microsoft Corp. from acquiring leading video game developer Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its blockbuster gaming franchises such as Call of Duty, alleging that the $69 billion deal, Microsoft’s largest ever and the largest ever in the video gaming industry, would enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business.".</p>
<p>The whole deal has been alarming in some ways, because of the constant increasing amount of developers and publishers being swallowed up by bigger companies. This consolidation of power is never a good thing for consumers as a whole. It's not just a Microsoft problem, it's an industry problem. Take Embracer for example, they own or control around 850 franchises and 132 development studios. </p>

      <title>Steam Deck Client Beta fixes up New Big Picture Mode overlay sizing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More quick fixes from Valve for the Steam Deck this weekend, with a small <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3637250052877233882" target="_blank">bug fix release</a> out for the Steam Deck Client Beta.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the new Big Picture Mode overlay being incorrect sized when the monitor is set to display scaling other than 100%</li>
<li>Fixed DLC hover on game details page being cropped</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with gamepad navigation in the Steam Deck haptics calibration screen</li>
<li>Fixed an issue w/ enabling Gyro for Switch controllers</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's available in both the Beta and Preview update channels. You can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Seems Valve also did the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3627116953531107087" target="_blank">same update</a> for the desktop Steam client too.</p>
<p>Also if you didn't see on the GamingOnLinux YouTube, I recently took a look at Marvel's Midnight Suns. Overall it's pretty good but I'm looking forward to some performance optimizations and hopefully a fix for some of the crashes people have been seeing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="69g7N0celto"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1440839a02821bab3953221a0b90c044.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/69g7N0celto" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On top of that I gave The Callisto Protocol a fresh set of benchmarks after the first patch. The second patch didn't change this for Proton / Steam Deck, so I'm waiting for more patches to see if it improves it at all again. Right now it's still really rough on performance no matter what settings you use on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Windows compatibility layer Wine v8.0 has a first Release Candidate out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another year is coming to a close and so the team behind Wine, the Windows compatibility layer, are readying up for another major stable release with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/8.0-rc1" target="_blank">version 8.0</a>. For those just joining us: Wine is one of the big parts of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> to run Windows games on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>They do regular development releases usually every two weeks with new features and fixes. However, with a new Release Candidate out, they're going into a code-freeze so they focus on just bug fixing and polishing now.</p>
<p>Included highlights of Wine 8.0 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bundled vkd3d upgraded to version 1.6.</li>
<li>Vulkan and OpenGL thunking optimizations.</li>
<li>More support for print processors.</li>
<li>Improved joystick control panel.</li>
<li>Long types printf format conversion finished.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their own vkd3d, not to be confused with Valve's VKD3D-Proton, had its 1.6 release only recently that included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial support for HLSL compute shaders.</li>
<li>More support for HLSL features and intrinsics.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of bugs were noted to be solved including issues for: Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2, The Void, Ragnarok Online, installers for various games and plenty of fixes to all the miscellaneous parts of Windows the Wine has to translate.</p>

      <title>Flying dogs that live on a whale, Flock of Dogs sounds weird and you can try it free</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Flock of Dogs from dev Max Clark is a thoroughly odd and unique top-down, action and adventure game about dogs flying around that live on a whale. It released in Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/812380/Flock_of_Dogs/" target="_blank">Steam</a> recently, with a little mini-park you can mess about in for free. The developer said it's inspired by "storybooks, cartoons, and neighborhood parks".</p>
<p>Split into two parts with the mini-park being free, you do have to pay for the rest of the actual game which will come as a DLC at some point later. In the mini-game you get to do this free:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joust on dogback, feed your whale, race on tracks you design.</li>
<li>Customize your dog at the Build-A-Pup 3000.</li>
<li>Toss squeaky balls, pop balloons, and mow the lawn.</li>
<li>Help the grumpy park ranger uncover sacred park secrets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flight to the Festival, the paid DLC, whenever it arrives will have this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go on a co-op, procedurally generated, road trip through the sky.</li>
<li>Feed and water your dogs and puppies.</li>
<li>Descend into caves, battle across the Blue Blob Lands, pick up hitchhikers.</li>
<li>Pilot a friendly skywhale, use its large belly to stash your loot.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Anti-grav Wipeout tribute racer BallisticNG v1.3 adds new tracks, vehicles and game modes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BallisticNG is honestly one of the best fast-paced anti-gravity racers around that's inspired by Wipeout, and they just had the 1.3 release out with plenty of new content.</p>
<p>This update honestly looks like a lot of fun with 8 new tracks designed for smaller vehicles, and naturally they've put in some smaller anti-gravity racers just for this. These smaller pedestrian sized vehicles kickstart a whole new class for the game, and there's a campaign to go along with it. Quite an update!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tG43rcdEC6U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc858c5b95b73dc04cea2af857bb9b1f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tG43rcdEC6U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On top of that there's a Unity game engine upgrade, modding updates, multiple new vehicles (although some are cheats) like a forklift (yes really), more cheat options, physics upgrades, multiplayer improvements, more events added to existing campaigns, a refreshed UI and more.</p>
<p>Another big one is the addition of the Stunt Mode, and I don't think that needs a huge explainer. All about doing barrel rolls, and racking up as many points as possible. Their video below on it looks completely ridiculous with the hovering forklift but I also now want to give it a try.</p>

      <title>Alterium Shift looks like a fun upcoming retro-styled RPG with a big new demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Alterium Shift is inspired by the JRPG greats, it's coming to Steam with Native Linux support and it has a brand new demo now available. Definitely reminds me of a few classics I played back in the day, with the developers saying they were inspired directly by older SNES titles and their love of games like Chrono Trigger and FFVI.</p>
<p>"Choose between three heroes in training; Pyra, Atlas, and Sage. Their teacher, Dolion, strives to mold his students into heroes, ones better than himself. The three heroes are taking their final test before being sent off on an important and life changing mission. Each character has a unique story path to experience and each path is filled with choices that are directed by the player. What fate awaits these heroes and can they accomplish the tasks set forth before them?"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Desktop Steam and Steam Deck Client Beta updates with new launch options UI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has replaced another old part of Steam in the latest Desktop and Steam Deck Client Beta, with a new UI for games that have launch options set.</p>
<p>Currently, if you go to launch a game that has options to pick that can be anything developers set like graphics APIs, VR or not VR, modded or unmodded and so on you get this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15361091901670599267gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15361091901670599267gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Now, instead, you get a nicer looking list and you can set that as the default so you're not asked every single time you launch. Very useful.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16480637911670599275gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16480637911670599275gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>If you do want to change it after, you can just go into the game's properties and tweak it to something else or make it ask you every time again:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/806676401670599283gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/806676401670599283gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8015853231670599484gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8015853231670599484gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>For the Steam Deck, this change is currently only for the desktop mode client as they haven't yet added it to Gaming Mode.</em></p>

      <title>Lots of good stuff announced at The Game Awards 2022 — roundup</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Game Awards 2022 is over and there was a surprising amount of big new announcements, so here's a little run over some of what's coming. Most of the announcements were games coming to Steam, so a lot of them will be playable on desktop Linux and Steam Deck too thanks to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> compatibility layer.</p>
<p>However, for Native Linux fans, there was one announcement there — a new DLC for Dead Cells named <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101430/Dead_Cells_Return_to_Castlevania/" target="_blank">Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania</a></strong>.</p>
<p>"The inspiration behind it all returns to its 2D action roots! Castlevania’s unforgettable characters &amp; gothic setting meet the fast-paced combat of the award-winning roguelite Dead Cells in this unprecedented collaboration."</p>

<p>Now onto basically everything else that will need Steam Play Proton…</p>
<p>A series many have been practically begging to have another game, <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888160/ARMORED_CORE_VI_FIRES_OF_RUBICON/" target="_blank">ARMORED CORE VI FIRES OF RUBICON</a></strong> was announced.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1774580/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Survivor/" target="_blank">STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor</a></strong> was shown off with a new trailer, and it got a release date of March 17th, 2023.</p>
<p>"The story of Cal Kestis continues in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor™, a third-person, galaxy-spanning, action-adventure game from Respawn Entertainment, developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games. This narratively driven, single-player title picks up 5 years after the events of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order™ and follows Cal’s increasingly desperate fight as the galaxy descends further into darkness. Pushed to the edges of the galaxy by the Empire, Cal will find himself surrounded by threats new and familiar. As one of the last surviving Jedi Knights, Cal is driven to make a stand during the galaxy’s darkest times — but how far is he willing to go to protect himself, his crew, and the legacy of the Jedi Order?"</p>

<p>Here's one I originally finished on the PlayStation 3, and it has to be one of my all-time favourite single-player stories with <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/" target="_blank">The Last of Us Part I</a></strong> coming on March 3rd, 2023.</p>

<p>I guess I'll really need to properly play Hades now that <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/" target="_blank">Hades II</a></strong> has been announced, and will come to Early Access.</p>
<p>"The first-ever sequel from Supergiant Games builds on the best aspects of the original god-like rogue-like dungeon crawler in an all-new, action-packed, endlessly replayable experience rooted in the Underworld of Greek myth and its deep connections to the dawn of witchcraft."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="l-iHDj3EwdI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/50b43e2eb881f8fc6e72475152ed02f3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/l-iHDj3EwdI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/388860/Judas/" target="_blank">Judas</a></strong> is one fans of BioShock need to keep an eye on!</p>
<p>"A disintegrating starship. A desperate escape plan. You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn? Judas is a narrative FPS developed by Ghost Story Games, a studio led by Ken Levine, Director of System Shock 2, BioShock, and BioShock Infinite."</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/668580/Atomic_Heart/" target="_blank">Atomic Heart</a></strong> got a new trailer for the event too, releasing 21st February, 2023.</p>
<p>"In a mad and sublime utopian world, take part in explosive encounters. Adapt your fighting style to each opponent, use your environment and upgrade your equipment to fulfill your mission. If you want to reach the truth, you'll have to pay in blood."</p>

<p>The final one I'll include is one I'm very much excited for. <strong>Death Stranding 2</strong>! This one has only been announced for console so far, but given Sony's push onto Steam I've no doubt eventually it will see a release we can all attempt to play and possibly understand some of the story.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KYV3bz8kQGM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/db094676017f98d6747d89ee80b75376.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KYV3bz8kQGM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1382070/Viewfinder/" target="_blank">Viewfinder</a></strong> looks like a very interesting puzzle game, that takes some of the ideas of Superliminal into a much more open setting.</p>
<p>"Challenge perception, redefine reality, and reshape the world around you with an instant camera. Viewfinder is a new single player game offering gamers hours of interesting and fun experiences while uncovering the mysteries left behind."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OQAacMRZBpY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0024808df8cd9fedb79fe36cad387509.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OQAacMRZBpY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Proton Experimental upgraded to fix the EA App failing to update on Steam Deck &amp; Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>When the EA App replaced Origin on Steam, it came with a whole bunch of problems for gamers on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. Now, it should hopefully be sorted in Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Initially Valve had to put out an update in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/valve-fix-new-ea-app-in-proton-experimental-for-linux-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">early November</a> to fix the EA App being blank in Proton, and everything seemed fine. That was until the EA App was updated, it broke — every time. You had to work around it, which I covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/how-to-fix-the-ea-app-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">in a brief guide</a> recently to fix it when it died but it seems that should no longer be the case in the latest Proton Experimental release for December 8th.</p>
<p>Newly playable for this update is <em>eXceed - Gun Bullet Children</em>. Other fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix EA Desktop failing to update rendering games unplayable (may require a few game restarts).</li>
<li>Fix Forza Horizon having wrong default mappings with Logitech G920 wheel.</li>
<li>Fix experimental regression: Star Wars: The Old Republic launcher failing to open.</li>
<li>Update dxvk-nvapi to <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/releases/tag/v0.6" target="_blank">v0.6</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this will fix it properly this time! What a damn nuisance extra launchers are.</p>
<p>Changelog available <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>. As a reminder (for desktop), you now need Mesa 22 / Nvidia drivers 510.47 or newer for Proton Experimental. Steam Deck is fine.</p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video:</p>

<li>Pick a game and head to the little COG icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>

      <title>System76 give everything you need with the Launch Heavy keyboard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After releasing the Launch and the Launch Lite, System76 is back with the <a href="https://system76.com/accessories/launch" target="_blank">Launch Heavy keyboard</a> which includes a NumPad. They sent over a unit and here’s my review.</p>
<p>Their idea for their original Launch keyboard, according to their press release, was a desire to provide customers of their Thelio desktops "with additional USB-C and USB-A ports that were easily accessible" and a "fully configurable keyboard allowed them to accomplish this while creating a holistic experience with the comprehensive list of shortcuts introduced in COSMIC" (COSMIC being their GNOME Shell customisations). Later the Launch Lite did away with the USB hub to<br/>
provide a more affordable <em>and</em> smaller option. Now, they've gone super-sized, well — compared with the previous models anyway.</p>
<p>So what is it? The Launch Heavy is a bigger and more useful version of the same if you don't need to move it around anywhere. It has the same incredibly sleek and solid design that has some real weight to it, so there's no slipping about. It comes equipped with 2 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 x 1 Type C and 2 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 x 1 Type A along the back, giving you plenty of expansion room too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2482355861670506793gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2482355861670506793gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It features Kailh MX Hotswap Sockets with a choice between Kailh Box Jade, Royal, Silent Pink or Silent Brown Switches. They gave me a choice on what switches to test, so checking out the little soundboard on their <a href="https://system76.com/accessories/launch" target="_blank">official site</a> (scroll down), I thought the Brown switches sounded the most muted for a less <em>clacky</em> typing experience. That was a good choice too, because wow — they're really smooth to type on and honestly, I like the sound even better than the already very good Cherry MX keys on my Corsair Strafe.</p>
<p>Since I know a lot of people will ask about shipping to Europe and other keyboard layouts, I asked System76 and they said this:</p>
<p>"Due to the current state of the economy and economic forecasts, we are postponing our European expansion plans for now. However, we are dedicated to supplying our European customers and still plan to expand into Europe in the future. That being said, we do plan on having more layouts for the Launch line. In fact, we already have ISO layouts and legends at the factory. Once our plans resume, we will decide whether to offer both US ANSI and ISO layouts or US ANSI to begin local distribution."</p>
<p><em>When I hear anything new on that, I’ll be sure to let you know. Now, back to the review.</em></p>
<p>On the back of the unit, it has two magnetic strips you can stick on either edge to tilt the keyboard for more comfort. These are actually great, and far far better than the rubbish plastic flick-outs from most other keyboards I've seen. They're just as solid and sturdy as the rest of the keyboard, and they won't break. The magnets involved are surprisingly strong too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6427315771670519822gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6427315771670519822gol1.gif"/></a><br/>
<em>The strength on the magnetic strips really is impressive.</em></p>
<p>It’s quite rare for me to get so attached to a peripheral like this. Even though I reviewed the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/the-system76-launch-configurable-keyboard-is-tiny-sturdy-and-very-slick/" target="_blank">original Launch keyboard</a> and liked using it, the Heavy is a whole different world of enjoyment because I generally go for bigger sizes like this because I just find it more comfortable. </p>
<p>To give you an example on the size difference, here's the Heavy next to the original Launch (not the Lite). And then also the Heavy compared with the full size Corsair Strafe RGB (click to enlarge them):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16030645121670520435gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16030645121670520435gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17711981011670521084gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17711981011670521084gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Part of what makes it great is all the open source behind it. The schematics and custom PCB are available, the code for the configuration app is open, the firmware is open too based on QMK and so on. Through and through, it's open source and you can see plenty of it on <a href="https://github.com/system76/launch" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>There's truly not a lot I didn't like about it, aside from some minor points on the layout. However, it's a fully configurable keyboard and that is again one of the high points about it. Don't like where something is? Open the app and change it. I'll give you an example. I was not a fan of the Left ALT and Left Super being swapped. I don't know why they were. So, using the official cross-platform open source keyboard <a href="https://system76.com/accessories/launch/download" target="_blank">configurator app</a>. I swapped them around and then used their useful little gadget to physically pull out the keys and swap them on the keyboard directly. Absolutely no fuss at all, it felt like the future, making tech work for me and not the other way around like it usually is with hardware (especially so on Linux).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7151561571670457484gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7151561571670457484gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"Why are there two spacebars?" I hear you scream at your screen. The answer there is pretty simple: they <em>want</em> you to customise it. Is there a key that you could regularly use on one side that might make it easier or just nicer to reach? Pull off one of them, and stick a different key down. I thought about that for quite a while, and even as I'm typing this I'm  very much aware now that it's always my left thumb pressing the spacebar so the right side of it is doing absolutely nothing — I could change that key for something else I might actually use.</p>
<p>They do also include a bunch of extra keys in the box too like a Pop!_OS logo key to replace the Super key (nice touch), same again with a 76 (as in, System76) and other logos people with System76 would be familiar with. Then there's a few others like coloured keys for Esc, a bigger Esc key, a coloured Up / Down and so on. They clearly put a lot of thought into a lot of what people will use it for specifically.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2442611151670457862gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2442611151670457862gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The unit arrived on November 22nd, and I've been using it exclusively for all my time on my PC since, including writing this very article you're reading right now. It took me all of a day to get used to it, and after that it has been insanely smooth sailing. It is a keyboard though, if it was in any way difficult, then they would have done something badly wrong but I'm sure you get my point. It's seriously great.</p>
<p>I will truly be sad to see this unit go back to System76, it gets a very firm seal of approval from me. Going back to my regular old Corsair Strafe now feels like a cheap child's toy in comparison to what this offers. There's really no contest here, this keyboard is in a league of its own.</p>
<p>The thing is: I've been trying to think of any negatives about using this keyboard to give you both sides of the coin and I don't think I have any. Actually, there is one, the US layout since I'm in the UK but even with that my fingers go on auto-pilot through muscle memory touch-typing and it hasn't been a problem, it just would be nice to eventually have my normal key layout available because then it's pretty much perfection. I'm going to correct myself with a minor point: much like their other variants, there's no lights for things like CAPS Lock but again, I've not actually needed it, just something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>If you’re after a new keyboard and want to support a Linux vendor doing such amazingly high-quality hardware, it’s a ridiculously <em>easy</em> recommendation. If the previous smaller sizes put you off — this should make you feel at home.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10981933821670367622gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>With this level of quality in their hardware, System76 is the Linux vendor to beat. This is technically their third product I’ve taken a look at (if you count their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/initial-thoughts-hp-dev-one-laptop-with-pop-os/" target="_blank">team up with HP</a>) and I feel like I need more of their stuff. The Thelio sure does look nice, I adore the case on it.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is the pricing. They're not cheap, and compared with various keyboards from other vendors, System76 are expensive. Still, it's hard to knock the quality, you very much get what you pay for here. It feels like it would outlast <em>me.</em></p>
<p>Launch Heavy pricing starts at $299. See more on the <a href="https://system76.com/accessories/launch" target="_blank">System76 website</a>.</p>

      <title>Portal with RTX released free on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free for owners of the original, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2012840/Portal_with_RTX/" target="_blank">Portal with RTX</a> has released on Steam from Lightspeed Studios / NVIDIA.</p>
<p>There's no Native Linux support this time around, unlike with Quake II RTX, but it should still work with Steam Play Proton (NVIDIA told me it works). Valve even added a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/891390/history/?changeid=16987405" target="_blank">configuration</a> for it to have NVAPI enabled for Proton by default.</p>
<p>I'm unable to currently test it myself, as the people who run RPMFusion for Fedora have not updated the NVIDIA drivers for Fedora 37 yet from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/nvidia-puts-out-security-bulletin-for-various-driver-issues/" target="_blank">recent security incident</a> and you need a minimum NVIDIA driver version of 525.60.11. It doesn't need an NVIDIA GPU though, as they say it works on any GPU that supports Vulkan Ray Tracing.</p>
<p>You can see their launch party video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ms1W3TD9de0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc6e49db1d5d2f1db0cb267638309a75.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ms1W3TD9de0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what's been added includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full ray tracing - Portal with RTX uses a ray tracing technique known as path tracing or full ray tracing, which unifies all lighting effects, such as shadows, reflections, refractions and more, into a single ray tracing algorithm.</li>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS 3– DLSS 3 is a revolutionary breakthrough in neural graphics that massively boosts performance. Powered by fourth generation Tensor Cores and new Optical Flow Accelerator on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, DLSS 3 uses AI to generate additional high-quality frames with great image quality and responsiveness.</li>
<li>NVIDIA Reflex - Improves responsiveness by reducing end to end system latency, enabling players to feel more connected and immersed in the experience.</li>
<li>NVIDIA Real Time Denoisers (NRD) is a new spatio-temporal ray tracing denoising library that assists in denoising ray traced images in real-time, with superior performance and quality.<br/>
A new lighting system made possible by NVIDIA RTXDI, NVIDIA ReSTIR GI and the addition of physically based materials/rendering (PBR):</li>
<li>NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI) enables the addition of countless direct light sources, big and small, each casting light and shadows.</li>
<li>NVIDIA Reservoir Spatio Temporal Importance Resampling Global Illumination (ReSTIR GI) enhances indirect light, enabling it to bathe a scene and illuminate dark corners that are not lit directly. And it also works smarter than previous ray-traced global illumination techniques, improving the efficiency of our ray tracing denoiser.</li>
<li>Physically based materials/rendering (PBR) – the environment of Portal’s Aperture Labs is upgraded with material properties that emulate real life. This PBR system supports material properties for light emission, roughness, and metallicity that combine with ray tracing to enable lighting effects such as reflections, refraction, translucency, transparency and global illumination.</li>
<li>More detailed models – in-game objects have been remodeled to add more detail and increase realism.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Unciv the open source remake of Civilization V is heading to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unciv is a popular open source remake inspired directly by Civilization V. It's been around for a while now and it's finally heading to Steam. Available cross-platform for Linux, Windows and Android it's actually quite an impressive and expansive game that has been continuously upgraded for years.</p>
<p>It doesn't really look a whole lot like Civilization V, and the developer is clear on the GitHub you should play the originals if you want "high-res graphics, amazing soundtracks, animations etc" but if you're in the market for "a small, fast, moddable, FOSS, in-depth 4X that can still run on a potato" then Unciv might just be for you.</p>

<p>There's no current date for the Steam release just yet.</p>

      <title>EVERSPACE 2 developer gets a 1.65 million Euro grant from the German federal parliament</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EVERSPACE 2 appears to be quite a success for ROCKFISH Games, not only is it doing well on Steam with a Very Positive rating in Early Access but they just got a big bonus from the German federal parliament. They've been given a grant of 1.65 Million Euro to help them expand the game.</p>
<p>What is it? A fast-paced single-player spaceship shooter with worthwhile exploration in space and on planets, tons of loot, RPG elements, mining, and crafting While it's currently in Early Access, the developer has plans to release the game in full in 2023 which will include Native Linux support that was confirmed again in the PR.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“The government’s continued interest in supporting German studios shows a commitment to fostering local talent and the creation of new IP in a growing creative field,” shared Michael Schade, CEO of ROCKFISH Games. “As we close in on the launch of EVERSPACE 2 in 2023, our team is looking to what’s to come in the future, and this grant is helping make it happen. We’re excited to share that ROCKFISH Games will be using this grant as part of our €3.9 million major expansion for EVERSPACE 2 planned to release in 2024. While we’ll have more to share about this content in the future, I will say that this major expansion will give EVERSPACE fans more star systems to adventure in as we explore stories focused on the companions of EVERSPACE 2.”</p>
<p>In the PR they also confirmed that EVERSPACE (both games together 1 &amp; 2) has sold over 2.5 million copies. They also have multiple open <a href="https://rockfishgames.com/jobs/" target="_blank">job positions</a> to keep expanding the game.</p>
<p>A big new update was also released recently and the trailer is below:</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress on Steam is a smash hit, devs confirm future plans (like Linux support)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was pretty much a given that Dwarf Fortress was going to be popular on Steam, but the smash hit it has become is quite a surprise on just how well it's doing.</p>
<p>Currently it's the #1 top selling game on Steam, and according to the head of the publisher on <a href="https://twitter.com/tanyaxshort/status/1600492945345597441" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, it smashed through somewhere around 160K sales in under 24 hours that they expected to hit in around 2 months. On Steam it also already has an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating from over 6,000 people. On <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dwarf-fortress" target="_blank">Metacritic</a>, it also has a very high score from both journalists and users.</p>
<p>As I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/dwarf-fortress-arrives-on-steam-works-on-linux-desktop-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">already confirmed</a>, it works out of the box on Steam Deck and Linux desktop with Proton but going by their new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3631620553379809112" target="_blank">FAQ</a>, they do still fully plan Native Linux support as they have "already contacted a trusted programmer who will be looking into it". They're also reducing the price in a couple of regions that were hit hard by inflation.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>EA open source Fonttik, helps devs check text size &amp; contrast — plus patent pledges</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As part of their <a href="https://www.ea.com/commitments/positive-play/accessibility-patent-pledge" target="_blank">original initiative</a> about sharing patent pledge to not go after others on accessibility, EA have recently released Fonttik as open source to help game developers. Available on <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/fonttik" target="_blank">GitHub</a> under the BSD license along with Linux noted as supported, Fonttik is a way for developers to check text size &amp; contrast to help with accessibility.</p>
<p>From the GitHub page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fonttik is a console application and library created by EA Compliance &amp; Certification that processes images and videos highlighting compliant and not compliant text that meets and does not meet desired according to a set of guidelines. The guidelines checked by Fonttik ensure text has a minimum size relative to screen resolution or DPI and that it has sufficient luminance contrast against its background, according to desired criteria, to be readable or more likely to be readeable by color vision deficient people. Fonttik is not intended to guarantee, certify or otherwise validate an image or video's complance with legal, regulatory or other requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice move from EA, hope to see more like this out in the open.</p>
<p>On top of that, they've recently added more patents to this accessibility pledge, where they won't go after other developers and publishers for using them. The newly added patents include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11458388B1" target="_blank">US 11,458,388</a> - Machine learning system that automatically recommends controller configuration settings based on a player's specific gameplay style, skill and tendencies.</li>
<li><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10926173" target="_blank">US 10,926,173</a> - Player-designated custom voice utterances for controlling in-game actions of non-player characters (NPCs).</li>
<li><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10621317" target="_blank">US 10,621,317</a> - Audio-based authentication for pairing player accounts with voice controlled devices, allowing players to use voice utterances to interact with portions of a game in an authenticated manner.</li>
<li><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9772743" target="_blank">US 9,772,743</a> - Virtual joystick that moves based on the position of a player’s thumb on a touchscreen.</li>
<li><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11358054" target="_blank">US 11,358,054</a> - Using haptic feedback sequences to convey to players information displayed on a screen as well as inputs to press to select certain content.</li>
<li><a href="https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/pdf/us-11-504-625-b2.pdf" target="_blank">US 11,504,625</a> - Color blindness indication objects used in game to automatically determine, enable, and adjust color blind accessibility settings during a gameplay session of a video game.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting though, that EA are reserving their right to terminate this open patent pledge with anyone specific, if they or an affiliate "files a patent infringement lawsuit or other patent proceeding against EA, its affiliates, or partners". So basically, don't go after EA and they won't go after you.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 21.1 now in Beta with full Flatpak support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint 21.1 is now available in Beta to get testing, based upon Ubuntu 22.04 with kernel 5.15 it's a long-term support release so you'll be able to continue using it until 2027 before needing a major update.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot new with this release, other than a bump to the versions of various packages that comes with the updated Ubuntu base so here's a short run over some things to expect from it.</p>
<p>The first thing people may notice is an update to the theme, for a refreshed look and feel. This includes a removal of unneeded items from the desktop, my vibrant colouring for accents, a change to Aqua by default so say goodbye to Linux Mint being green out of the box and a new mouse pointer theme.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17121803141670502251gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17121803141670502251gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Other major changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driver Manager no longer needd a password to launch, plus improved offline support and fixes for NVIDIA.</li>
<li>Full Flatpak integration in the Update Manager.</li>
<li>More places needing a password prompt were removed that don't need administrative permissions.</li>
<li>Right click on desktop now has a Display Settings option.</li>
<li>A refreshed interface for the Software Manager, that makes it easier to tell the difference between Flatpak and normal packages. Plus you can switch between them if an app has both.</li>
<li>A Verify ISO tool was added.</li>
<li>Other visual changes include a seperator next to the Mint Menu button, a corner bar applet on the far right of the panel inspired by Windows 10, selecting an item in the file manager Nemo only highlights the name now and not the icon as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of which can be seen in the <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/rel_vera_cinnamon_whatsnew.php" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel using DXVK (part of Steam Proton) for their Windows Arc GPU DX 9 drivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel recently announced a big driver update for their Arc GPUs on Windows, because their DirectX 9 performance wasn't as good as it could have been. Turns out, they're using code from the open source <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a> which is part of Steam Play Proton.</p>
<p><em>Translation layers are everywhere it seems, especially for older software and APIs now.</em></p>
<p>DXVK translates Direct3D 9, Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 11 to Vulkan. Primarily written for <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a>, the Windows compatibility layer, which is what Proton is made from (Proton is what the majority of games on Steam Deck run through). However, it also has a Native implementation for Linux and it can be used even on Windows too. So it's not a big surprise to see this. Heck, even NVIDIA use DXVK for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/nvidia-announces-ada-lovelace-their-3rd-generation-rtx-dlss-3-and-portal-rtx/" target="_blank">RTX Remix</a>.</p>
<p>In their announcement video below, they talk about how they did a "native implementation of DX9" and "there will be times when games are running on our native DX implementation, but there'll be other times when we take advantage of translation layers to go from DX 9 to a more modern API". Their <a href="https://game.intel.com/story/intel-arc-graphics-directx9/?cid=iosm&amp;source=twitter&amp;campid=intel_graphics_experiences_worldwide&amp;content=100003580095787&amp;icid=axg-client-graphics-gmo-campaign&amp;linkId=100000169346333" target="_blank">blog post</a> also mentions this hybrid approach, but neither the blog post nor video <em>actually</em> say it's DXVK. You only find that out when you look through <a href="https://downloadmirror.intel.com/761751/readme.txt" target="_blank">their readme</a>, to find the DXVK note and license.</p>
<p>They say the way it works will be transparent to the end user, so they likely just have a list of games where the driver switches between DXVK or their own work.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="omUTYlm2Al0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cf826a3b99c3a1a7476ce1f2b29b9381.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/omUTYlm2Al0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>It's amazing to see open source everywhere. </em></p>
<p>While this isn't for Linux directly, the more companies that end up using the same translation tools we use, the better they could get. Hopefully Intel will also end up helping with DXVK work from this too and not keep any improvements to themselves.</p>

      <title>Blender 3.4 is out now with Wayland support on Linux, Intel&#39;s Open Path Guiding added</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blender, the absolute power-house free and open source 3D creation suite, has a big release out with Blender 3.4 and it's awesome. Used across film and games, it's one of the best FOSS projects around and has shown how FOSS can be a huge success.</p>
<p>For Linux users Blender 3.4 is especially sweet, since it now offers native Wayland support in addition to X11. They say with this release it has been tested working across GNOME Shell (Mutter), KDE (Plasma) &amp; Sway (wlroots) based compositors.</p>
<p>One of the big overall features in this release is the inclusion of Intel's <a href="https://github.com/OpenPathGuidingLibrary/openpgl/" target="_blank">Open Path Guiding Library</a>, which the Blender team say adds support for "path guiding in CPU to help reduce noise in scenes where finding a path to light is difficult for regular path tracing, for example when a room is lit by light coming through a small door crack" — sounds very useful.  The example they showed in the <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/3-4/" target="_blank">release page</a> shows what a massive improvement it can be too.</p>
<p>I can recommend checking this video for a quick overview of some features:</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to fix Grounded from Obsidian on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/962130/Grounded/" target="_blank">Grounded</a> seems like a genuinely fun survival adventure, where you or you <em>and</em> friends can run around as miniturized people and survive against all kinds of critters. Out of the box on Steam Deck it's completely broken, so here's how to fully fix it.</p>
<p>There's two problems at play here: the first is that it will freeze on the loading screen. The second, is that for people who wish to play online, the Xbox login screen is completely blank. Both can be solved and it's pretty quick to do too.</p>
<p>Here's a video guide, with the text guide below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cNH8Y3rFPMw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/217b2ef76cb94ba4f58996731058e3a9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cNH8Y3rFPMw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>In your Steam Library right click on Grounded and go to Properties -&gt; Local Files -&gt; Browse.</li>
<li>Go into the Maine folder, then into Binaries and Win64. Inside here either remove or rename the file named SpeechSynthWrapper.dll. This will fix the game not loading.</li>
<li>To solve the Xbox login screen being blank: download ProtonUp-Qt from the Discover software centre. Then open it and download Proton-6.21-GE-2. It's the last in the 6 series, shortly before it became named "GE-Proton" instead.</li>
<li>Set Proton-6.21-GE-2 as the forced compatibility layer in the Properties for Grounded. Hit play, and the Xbox login screen will work and you can login just fine. You might need to focus entry on the text input with touch screen or mouse input, you also need to manually bring up the Steam keyboard with STEAM + X.</li>
<li>After that, quit the game and uncheck the forced compatibility layer to keep it on the latest official Proton that has all the latest fixes.</li>
<li>Enjoy.</li>

      <title>Vampire Survivors: Legacy of the Moonspell arrives December 15th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors: Legacy of the Moonspell is the first expansion for the absolutely ridiculous smash-hit horde game. It releases on December 15th with a whole bunch of extra content.</p>
<p>This DLC will include 8 new characters, of which they've only revealed 4:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Miang Moonspell</strong> - The last disciple of the Moonspell Clan before its downfall, and possibly its finest. Self-consciously a shounen protagonist.</li>
<li><strong>Menya Moonspell</strong> - One of the few surviving Moonspell elders, Menya’s mystical powers are near god-like.</li>
<li><strong>Syuuto Moonspell</strong> - Banished practitioner of the new moon dark magic, Syuuto is nonetheless an enemy of evil. Poor personal hygiene may contribute to his continued exile.</li>
<li><strong>Babi-Onna</strong> - Returned from the dead to seek vengeance on demons and mortals alike, she nonetheless retains her impeccable ability to charm, amuse, and dazzle.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6236818991670416939gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6236818991670416939gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>13 new weapons and they've so far revealed these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Silver Wind</strong> - An ancestral force unleashed by the staff of the Moonspell Clan, only those born under the moon can fully wield its power (or whoever finds it in a chest, we’re not sure).</li>
<li><strong>Four Seasons</strong> - A set of orbs which unleash the power of the changing seasons, of death and rebirth.</li>
<li><strong>Summon Night</strong> - A weapon which drips with the darkness of the new moon. Despite the clan’s superstitions, even the shadows can oppose evil.</li>
<li><strong>Mirage Robe</strong> - An enchanted kimono, weaved on a loom from the silk of the earth spider, and imbued with a fragment of Babi-Onna’s vengeful spirit. Besides, it looks fabulous darling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus a brand new stage, that is the biggest one yet along with a bunch of new music to go along with it.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the developers are currently porting it to a new game engine and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/vampire-survivors-10-coming-october-20th-seems-a-linux-port-is-still-planned/" target="_blank">have plans for a Native Linux version</a> of that too. There is currently a <em>hidden</em> Native Linux version on the existing game engine, but it's not recommended or advertised by the developer. It works pretty nicely in Proton overall right now.</p>
<p>You can pick it up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Guitar Hero inspired free game Clone Hero version 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Games like Guitar Hero were once massively popular but developers seem to have moved on, thankfully there's Clone Hero which is a free game based on the idea. Available cross-platform with support for Linux, macOS, Windows and Android. You can play it with any 5 or 6 fret guitar controller, any midi drum kit, any game controller and even your keyboard.</p>
<p>After being in development for 3 years, the big 1.0 release is finally here. The creator said it will now go into long-term support mode for bug fixes, but no major new features as it's finished and complete. </p>
<p>Some of what's new includes: worldwide public servers for online play, drums support, more customization options, player profiles added a bunch of new features, new gameplay modifiers and much more.</p>

      <title>Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla is impressive on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Assassin's Creed Valhalla has launched on Steam and that means getting it on Steam Deck and Linux desktop is much easier, since Valve have Proton. The experience on Steam Deck is surprisingly good too.</p>
<p>That's right, Ubisoft are back on Steam as they previously announced. This is the first of multiple others coming to Steam including Anno 1800 and Roller Champions. Annoyingly, it does use their own launcher like EA games. However, it seems to be a lot less problematic than the EA App with login, 2FA and Steam Account Linking all working just fine out of the box.</p>
<p>In the below video (using SteamOS 3.4 Preview) you'll see a 4-way benchmark, and then gameplay and then a final section showing what the battery life will be like out of the box (spoiler: not great). You're likely going to want to do some power limiting from the Steam Deck performance menu for this one, and getting a solid 30FPS even bringing down the power seems like it will be quite easily achievable in this one. Seems like Ubisoft did a surprisingly good job at optimizing the game overall considering how well it can run on Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VYM0rVVw_dI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/03a59310011e75b790c6214e4495f17f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VYM0rVVw_dI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208920/Assassins_Creed_Valhalla/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> and it's 67% off until December 22nd which seems like a really great deal. Looks like another game I'll be playing through, once I finish Death Stranding Director's Cut (after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/death-stranding-directors-cut-has-an-annoying-issue-that-can-reboot-your-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Deck rebooting bug</a> gets fixed…).</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress arrives on Steam, works on Linux desktop and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwarf Fortress has now finally arrived on Steam, with all the shiny new bits including the new graphical tiles and audio included in Early Access. The good news is that even though it doesn't have Native Linux support <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/dwarf-fortress-releases-december-6-on-steam-and-itchio-native-linux-support-later/" target="_blank">yet</a>, it does work on Linux desktop and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>It doesn't have controller support though, so on Steam Deck you'll need to mess about with Steam Input for a while to set it up how you want. I have no doubt it won't be long before someone makes a good one. To be honest with you, like a lot of people I was never able to get into it originally, it was a bit too retro for my tastes but this new more modern version definitely seems like something I can get into. The short guided tutorial is certainly a nice touch.</p>
<p>Steam Deck screenshots:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11053347001670342359gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11053347001670342359gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7572633191670342361gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7572633191670342361gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Seems like you might get pretty good battery life out of it on Steam Deck too.</em></p>
<p>There's no Cloud Save support yet though, which for a game as big as this feels like a huge oversight. Even if you only play on one device, it's always good to have that backup there.</p>
<p><em>Both Steam Deck and Desktop Linux were tested with Proton 7.0-4.</em></p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Not just generated geometry -- a whole simulated world. Generated rise and fall of civilizations, personalities, creatures, cultures, etc. Infinite hours of gameplay.</li>
<li>Now with beautiful pixel graphics!</li>
<li>Learn the basics with in-game tutorials.</li>
<li>A lifetime “living” project - created/updated since 2003, with no end in sight.</li>
<li>Generate your unique world and manage a bustling colony of dwarves, even as they probably mine towards their eventual demise.</li>
<li>A new endless hobby, just for you!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

Nice to see they've been really quick to deal with some of the problems, including sideloaded apps not being added to Steam automatically that I pointed out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10482096441670336011gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10482096441670336011gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what's been fixed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix the issue with the download's progress going crazy and duplicating the installation/update.</li>
<li>Fix a crash on the Install dialog on some games.</li>
<li>Fix sideload games not being added to steam automatically.</li>
<li>Fix Games failing to start when launched from Steam because they have an update.</li>
<li>Fix games falling to start when launched from Steam when they had Sync Saves but the path was not defined.</li>
<li>Fix Auto detect saves path going on forever. Now it will have a timeout of 15s.</li>
<li>Fix GOG games failing to install due to not supported language error.</li>
<li>Increased the connectivity check timeout at startup and added a button to ignore the status.</li>
<li>[macOS] Fixed an issue where the game save path was not correct for native games.</li>
<li>[Linux/macOS] Fix the windows version of a game version being recognized as native and not showing Wine settings and others.</li>
<li>Fix a crash that was happening when uninstalling Sideloaded Apps.</li>
<li>Fix Login Page container size max Width.</li>
<li>Possibly fix the state of the game card not correctly updating. Not showing an update button, for instance.</li>
<li>[Windows] Fix an issue where Heroic was crashing when opening the install dialog.</li>
<li>Heroic will clean the cache now after upgrading to a new release since some issues are associated with that after updating.</li>
<li>Some other minor fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently did a quick look at the last major version you can see below:</p>

      <title>Death Stranding Director&#39;s Cut has an annoying issue that can reboot your Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: a follower of ours on Mastodon pointed out it's a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/7735#note_1674704" target="_blank">Mesa driver issue</a> in the ACO shader compiler, and there's a fix noted so hopefully Valve will update the Steam Deck AMD GPU driver soon. <strong>Update #2</strong>: a Valve developer <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1600366661399642112" target="_blank">mentioned on Twitter</a> a fix is in testing.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Having recently finished Mass Effect Legendary Edition, I was in the mood for something different so I picked Death Stranding Director's Cut but it seems there's a rather annoying issue that can reboot your Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Tested across various versions of Proton: when you load up the map, as soon as you move the Right Joystick, the game will freeze and quite often crash so hard it will reboot my Steam Deck. When going to report the issue on the official Proton GitHub, it seems I was beaten to it a few days before by <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5758#issuecomment-1334882411" target="_blank">someone else</a> seeing the same issue. While I've only tested it on SteamOS 3.4 Preview, their report states it happens to them on the Stable channel too.</p>
<p><u>Workaround</u>: for now, I was able to work around it by setting the Right Joystick to Joystick Mouse in Steam Input, although that means I can no longer tilt the map but at least the game won't keep dying on me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zMguCPInqoQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2e36a2d17d5e55186edbe31a317004ee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zMguCPInqoQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It doesn't always reboot the Steam Deck though and took me three random crashing reboots to realise what was happening. Sometimes it will just lock up the game, other times the game will close with an <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1929168341670330173gol1.jpeg" target="_blank">error message</a>. Thoroughly annoying for a Deck Verified game.</p>
<p>A very confusing issue. Hopefully Valve will figure out what's going on if it's a game issue, a Proton issue, a Steam Input issue, an AMD GPU driver issue or something else.</p>

      <title>The Long Dark: Tales from the Far Territory out now as the game is split up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Long Dark: Tales from the Far Territory is the 12-month long expansion pass for The Long Dark and it's out now, along with the game now split into different parts.</p>
<p>As the developer detailed before, the main game is now the survival mode as their entry-level experience. With the Wintermute story mode now being a DLC, but all previous game owners were given it free since they purchased it as a whole thing originally.</p>
<p>The way the new Tales from the Far Territory works, is that people who buy this DLC will get all the extra features and new additions sprinkled in over the next 12 months (there will still be free updates too). The price will rise as the DLC expands and it's for real lovers of the survival game. See their <a href="https://www.thelongdark.com/expansion/faq/" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for more. Some of what they have planned includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three new Regions: Airfield, Industrial Mine, Mountain Pass.</li>
<li>Three new Tales, narrative-based Challenges that tie into the mysterious history of this Part of Great Bear Island.</li>
<li>Several new gameplay systems including the Travois, Safehouse Customization, Handheld Shortwave, Weapon &amp; Tool Variations, etc.</li>
<li>A bunch of new improvements to existing systems, like Clothing Items, new Harvestables, etc.</li>
</ul>

      <title>MineClone2 version 0.81.0 (free Minecraft-like) for Minetest out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=16407" target="_blank">MineClone2</a> is pretty much as close as you can get to Minecraft without playing Minecraft. It's free, open source and runs on the <a href="https://www.minetest.net/" target="_blank">Minetest</a> voxel game engine. A new release is now available with version 0.81.0.</p>
<p>I doubt it will need much of an introduction for people new to it: a sandbox game where you go and do whatever you want. The new release requires either 5.5.1 or 5.6.0 at a minimum.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20946310021670326956gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20946310021670326956gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the main highlights from the new version include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A rewrite of signs, including coloured text.</li>
<li>Villager schedule implemented, villager fixes.</li>
<li>Nether terrain generation improved for a lot more open space.</li>
<li>Nether bulwark (mini-bastion) added.</li>
<li>Nether bridge fragment.</li>
<li>Strider mob added.</li>
<li>Raids added.</li>
<li>Axolotl mob added.</li>
<li>Beehives and honey added.</li>
<li>Ocean temples added.</li>
<li>Lots more including various AI improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Minetest has quite a lot of mods, and a few big game packs like this. If you've not tried Minetest or MineClone2 for a while, it looks like a good time to jump back in.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA talks up RTX IO with GDeflate (used in DirectStorage 1.1) to speed up games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vulkan version 1.3.233 was released back in November, and with it came two new extensions from NVIDIA designed to help speed up gaming on Linux and Windows. Their tech is even used in DirectStorage from Microsoft.</p>
<p>The new extensions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>VK_NV_memory_decompression - This extension adds support for performing memory to memory decompression.</li>
<li>VK_NV_copy_memory_indirect - This extension adds support for performing copies between memory and image regions using indirect parameters that are read by the device from a buffer during execution. This functionality may be useful for performing copies where the copy parameters are not known during the command buffer creation time.</li>
</ul>
<p>It forms part of <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx-io" target="_blank">NVIDIA RTX IO</a>, that NVIDIA say will result in faster loading times, lower CPU utilisation, smaller assets so you get smaller game downloads and best of all — it's open source.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5577596711670323889gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5577596711670323889gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>NVIDIA also shared the below image, from testing compression with DirectStorage using the DirectStorage GPU Decompression Benchmark and they say "GDeflate GPU decompression delivers IO-saturating performance on modern NVMe devices".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16338194141670327238gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16338194141670327238gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>This tech uses the two Vulkan extensions anyone can implement, plus the GDeflate compression format (this is what Microsoft use in DirectStorage 1.1) and NVIDIA say that GDeflate "will be open source" too.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also talk up on their website how it's designed to work across "various operating systems and graphics APIs, computer-accelerated APIs, and SDKs" and that all "modern GPUs will benefit from the ability to speed up load times and reduce CPU utilization" but naturally they say it's best on their own Ada Lovelace architecture.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty exciting. I've seen numerous Linux gamers ask over the last few years if Linux will see anything like DirectStorage, so it's nice to see elements of it available in the open and cross-platform.</p>

<p>All owners of Saints Row IV are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/206420/view/3646256550316263153" target="_blank">getting bumped up</a> to the Saints Row IV: Re-Elected edition, plus cross-play across different stores. So players on Steam, GOG and Epic will be able to play together.</p>
<p>This means everyone who didn't have it before will gain access to the Enter the Dominatrix and How the Saints save Christmas mission DLC, plus various outfits and weapon DLC (there's quite a lot) including the Anime Pack, Dubstep Remix Pack, Presidential Pack, Wild West Pack and so on.</p>
<p>From the announcement it will go live for Windows on December 8th, with a note that it will be "later for Linux players". The Linux port was originally done by Virtual Programming, who we've not heard from or seen ports from in a long time, so it will be interesting to see if they do fully hook up the cross-play for the Linux version too.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwerve is an action-adventure with tower defense that released back in May, and they have a major update out now adding in a whole new mode more like classic tower defense games.</p>

      <title>Civilization VI updated properly for Linux from Aspyr but still has problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently Sid Meier's Civilization VI from Firaxis Games had a major update and DLC release <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/sid-meiers-civilization-vi-gets-a-leader-pass-breaks-it-on-linux-and-macos/" target="_blank">that broke it</a> on macOS and reverted to a really old version for Linux but porter Aspyr Media has partially fixed it for Linux now.</p>
<p>For the Native Linux build, it is at least now up to date with version 1.0.12.9 instead of the <em>really old</em> version they seemingly put up by accident. It still won't launch on a lot of newer Linux distributions without workarounds though, which Aspyr are likely to never fix and that has been a problem for years. This means the new Leader Pass should work fine.</p>
<p>As an example of the Linux workaround for the Native version, you can use a simple Steam Launch Option:</p>
<p>Arch:</p>
<p><code>LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libfreetype.so.6 %command%</code></p>
<p>Fedora:</p>
<p><code>LD_PRELOAD=/lib64/libfreetype.so.6 %command%</code></p>
<p>Debian:</p>
<p><code>LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so.6 %command%</code></p>
<p><em>I'm still honestly amazed such a seemingly simple library issue was left in for years. It's also surprising it took over a week for them to fix the wrong game version for Linux…</em></p>
<p>However, due to performance, you're likely <em>far</em> better off with the Windows version in Proton and you can work around the problematic 2K launcher with this Steam launch option:</p>
<p><code>eval $( echo "%command%" | sed "s/2KLauncher\/LauncherPatcher.exe'.*/Base\/Binaries\/Win64Steam\/CivilizationVI.exe'/" )</code></p>
<p>Seems like they haven't yet fixed it for macOS, with lots of complaints on Steam about it. Aspyr really dropped the ball on this update and the annoyance from users is quite understandable.</p>

      <title>OpenRA for classic Command &amp; Conquer, Dune 2000, Red Alert has a new Playtest</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.openra.net/" target="_blank">OpenRA</a> is one of my absolute favourite open source projects allowing you to play the Westwood classics like Command &amp; Conquer, Dune 2000 and Red Alert has a new <a href="https://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20221203/" target="_blank">Playtest</a> up over a year after the last release.</p>
<p>Some of the big highlights includes the new hierarchical pathfinder, which increases performance on large maps. New and improved netcode, better notifications for people playing without sound, a lot of balance and polish in Dune 2000 due to the rising popularity after the Dune filme and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11005969511670243653gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11005969511670243653gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Dune 2000 in the new Playtest</em></p>
<p>Here's an overview of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of the more visible new features and improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measures against sound / notification overlap. No more u-u-u-u-unit lost</li>
<li>Measures against spamming the multiplayer lobby and in-game chat</li>
<li>The ability to mute players</li>
<li>Support for disabling the chat in replays</li>
<li>An ingame encyclopedia in Dune 2000</li>
<li>New Red Alert missions</li>
<li>Community balance changes for all mods</li>
</ul>
<p>Notable changes for mappers and modders include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic map reloading in the background</li>
<li>A change to the way speed is calculated for ground units</li>
<li>A new map format which includes the map preview (minimap) in the map versioning (map hash)</li>
<li>Loaders for more audio formats (e.g., mp3 and ogg), and formats used by the remasters</li>
<li>Many linting and documentation updates</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as some other changes worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toolchain and changes to support the .NET 6 runtime</li>
<li>A massive amount of upgrades to both ingame and client UI</li>
<li>Many more hotkeys became rebindable</li>
<li>Substantial progress towards localisation</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a pretty good one too. The upcoming OpenRA version of Tiberian Sun saw plenty of work too, although <em>not</em> ready for release yet, they implemented unit tilting on slopes. It's a small visual feature but another part of what made the Tiberian Sun atmosphere and style so good for the time:</p>

      <title>ProtonPlus is a new in-development Proton version manager</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we already have ProtonUp-Qt which works just fine, it seems another thought they could do it better and differently with Proton version manager <a href="https://github.com/Vysp3r/ProtonPlus" target="_blank">ProtonPlus</a>. For those of your on GNOME desktops, you might like this one more eventually when it's more developed, since it's using GTK.</p>
<p>It's early days yet, with nothing pre-built and a lack of build instructions but it seems like they have a nice idea for it. To help you manage Proton for Steam, Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher and Bottles.</p>

      <title>Amnesia: The Bunker from Frictional Games announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Frictional Games have another Amnesia game coming next year with Amnesia: The Bunker that puts a gun in your hand with a single bullet, and it also features a semi-open world.</p>
<p>In a press release they said "For the first time, players are equipped with high levels of freedom to impact gameplay, choosing their playstyle as they explore at will this semi-open world. With hardly any scripted events, and constant tension brought about by an ever-present threat, it is up to each player to finesse their approach to survival.".</p>
<p>Certainly sounds interesting and a major departure from the previous games with "emergent gameplay and sandbox elements" thrown into the mix. You'll be walking through a dark WWI bunker as a French soldier, armed with a revolver gun and a noisy dynamo flashlight.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OxLSsDmtj-U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fac03ee69bb3acff7af79579d3672421.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OxLSsDmtj-U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Player choice - emergent gameplay in a sandbox horror survival experience</li>
<li>Unscripted environment - objects, threats, and resources, change in every playthrough</li>
<li>Adaptive horrid threats - an ever-present gruesome creature that stalks the player.  </li>
<li>Tactile immersion - all-new levels of interaction with the world through puzzle-solving and tool handling</li>
<li>Absorbing yet terrifying tale - experience hell on earth in a fictional appalling story</li>
<li>Engrossing atmosphere and tension - enhanced lighting effects and carefully designed sound effects for a real horror experience. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I reached out to Frictional to see if it will have a Native Linux build like all their previous games, however their official email bounced back and didn't accept it and no reply to a Twitter DM as of yet. So stay tuned. If it doesn't, then hopefully Steam Play Proton will run it nicely.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1944430/Amnesia_The_Bunker/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve are finally fixing buying games on Steam Deck that need a pop-up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's hard to imagine for a lot of people, buying games directly on Steam Deck has been <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/1/3186864655193756275/" target="_blank">broken</a> this long but Valve are finally looking to fix it.</p>
<p>The issue is that certain methods of payment, and probably only in certain countries, require a special pop-up browser window to do some security checks. It was broken at release of the Steam Deck, with an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-update-fixes-buying-games-for-some-touch-input-on-digital-keyboard-theme/" target="_blank">update</a> attempting to fix it back in March, which only fixed it for some.</p>
<p>In a fresh Steam Deck Beta Client <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3647382900914478171" target="_blank">Update</a>, the single note is that it "Fixed Store payment methods which require popup windows for processing not working".</p>
<p>Nice to see but that sure took a lot longer than expected for something so essential. It was frustrating, as every time I forgot it was broken, I then had to wait to buy it on my desktop because it was stuck since it didn't fully go through.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck OS 3.4 Preview adds support for 8BitDo Ultimate Wireless controller dongle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve put out a small and sweet <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3647382450221491185" target="_blank">update</a> for Steam Deck OS (SteamOS) 3.4 Preview, which adds in support for the <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2.4g-wireless-controller/" target="_blank">8BitDo Ultimate Wireless</a> controller dongle.</p>
<p>While it already worked in the Bluetooth mode, it didn't without a load of tinkering with the dedicated low-latency dongle. Nice to see Valve move quickly to support third-party pads like this. Must admit my own temptation to pick one up has increased. Seems like a nice controller, especially nice with the back paddles too.</p>

<p>Other additions in the update include rumble support to the built-in hid-steam controller driver and they fixed a USB crash when using certain controllers such as the Hori Fighting Stick α.</p>

      <title>Google are now processing Stadia Hardware refunds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the closing of Stadia fast approaching, Google has already run through plenty of refunds for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/stadia-refunds-are-starting-to-begin-no-word-on-controller-bluetooth-yet/" target="_blank">Stadia game purchases</a> and now they're moving onto Stadia Hardware refunds.</p>
<p>I have now received refunds for all of my Stadia game purchases, and just recently a fresh email entered my inbox from Google about Stadia Hardware. In the email it reiterated the January 18th, 2023 shutdown date and mentioned Google Store purchases of Stadia Hardware will be refunded "within two weeks" (from November 30th). So if you're waiting on the refund, you might want to keep an eye out soon.</p>
<p>For any issues on refunds, you'll get an email on how to proceed with an alternative account to get the money.</p>
<p>Stadia have a bunch of info in <a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/12790109" target="_blank">their FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>Did you game on Stadia and want to move progress over? So far <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1575922767593078793" target="_blank">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1575558847250411521" target="_blank">Bungie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1575818132492636162" target="_blank">I/O Interactive</a>, <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/stadia/sp-technical/issue/1709/where-are-my-game-saves-located-1" target="_blank">CD Projekt Red</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsColourTV/status/1582853316727275522" target="_blank">Rockstar Games</a> and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/10/20/elder-scrolls-online-stadia/" target="_blank">Bethesda</a> have already shared plans on that but it's down to each developer and publisher to sort it.</p>
<p>What a massive shame for a once promising Cloud Gaming service, Google just had no real idea of what they were doing or what the industry actually truly wanted. Thankfully, Cloud Gaming fans still have the likes of GeForce NOW, Xbox Cloud Gaming and Luna.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 update adds VScript and you can now run Linux inside it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not only has Team Fortress 2 been updated but it seems like quite a huge one thanks to the addition of VScript, and you can now run Linux inside it. That's right, TF2 came to Linux back in 2013 and now TF2 itself can run Linux. What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>Developer Joshua Ashton, who also works on DXVK and VKD3D-Proton (part of Steam Play Proton) has been busy it seems, helping out with other Valve projects like TF2 adding in VScript which enables map makers to do some pretty wild stuff. Here's the main <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=166703" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Implemented VScript
<ul>
<li>VScript allows mappers to embed script code (Squirrel3) into maps. This system is already being used for L4D2 and CS:GO maps.
<ul>
<li>Interface with entities and the world like regular Hammer logic</li>
<li>Simplify things that were previously incredibly complicated/tedious in Hammer logic</li>
<li>Interact with and control bots, bosses, player attributes, entities, and game state closely, allowing for enhanced, modified or entirely custom game modes</li>
<li>React to game events and change the outcome of certain things, such as damage calculations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More technical info about VScript for Team Fortress 2 is available on the Valve Developer Community
<ul>
<li>https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VScript</li>
<li>https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/List_of_TF2_Script_Functions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added the ability to change the skybox dynamically using the skybox_swapper entity or SetSkyboxTexture</li>
<li>Added support for custom MvM upgrade files packed into the map</li>
<li>Added point_worldtext, an entity that can show text dynamically, with support for multiple SDF (signed distance field) fonts, multiple colors and a rainbow mode</li>
<li>Exposed several movement related ConVars</li>
<li>Implemented support for func_monitor and cameras</li>
<li>Implemented logic_eventlistener for listening to game events from Hammer logic</li>
<li>Added the ability to pass parameters and delay to MvM populator actions</li>
<li>Improved compile time with VRAD</li>
<li>Special thanks to Jakub and everyone on the GitHub VScript Mega Issue for testing, providing feedback, and submitting requests</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Ashton even did a little video, to show Linux running <em>inside</em> Team Fortress 2 and you can find the code behind it on <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/riscv-vscript" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It's quite fascinating, and probably means it won't be long before someone puts Doom inside TF2 if they haven't already somehow.</p>

<p>Want to actually know more about it and what it can possibly do? YouTuber shounic, who I imagine you already know if you're into TF2, did a video on the Beta version of this which you can see below and explains it many times better than I could hope to for you:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA puts out Security Bulletin for various driver issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA today put out an official <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5415" target="_blank">Security Bulletin</a>, noting multiple flaws found in their Windows and Linux drivers. The good news is that drivers are already out that fix the problems, which I'll detail below.</p>
<p>Here's all those that affect Linux, brace yourself, there's quite a few of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34670 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an unprivileged regular user can cause truncation errors when casting a primitive to a primitive of smaller size causes data to be lost in the conversion, which may lead to denial of service or information disclosure.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42263 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an Integer overflow may lead to denial of service or information disclosure.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34676 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an out-of-bounds read may lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or data tampering.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42264 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where an unprivileged regular user can cause the use of an out-of-range pointer offset, which may lead to data tampering, data loss, information disclosure, or denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34674 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where a helper function maps more physical pages than were requested, which may lead to undefined behavior or an information leak.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34678 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where an unprivileged user can cause a null-pointer dereference, which may lead to denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34679 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an unhandled return value can lead to a null-pointer dereference, which may lead to denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34680 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an integer truncation can lead to an out-of-bounds read, which may lead to denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34677 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an unprivileged regular user can cause an integer to be truncated, which may lead to denial of service or data tampering.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34682 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where an unprivileged regular user can cause a null-pointer dereference, which may lead to denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42257 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an integer overflow may lead to information disclosure, data tampering or denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42265 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an integer overflow may lead to information disclosure or data tampering.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34684 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an off-by-one error may lead to data tampering or information disclosure.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42254 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an out-of-bounds array access may lead to denial of service, data tampering, or information disclosure.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42258 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an integer overflow may lead to denial of service, data tampering, or information disclosure.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42255 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an out-of-bounds array access may lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or data tampering.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42256 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an integer overflow in index validation may lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or data tampering.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34673 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an out-of-bounds array access may lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or data tampering.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42259 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an integer overflow may lead to denial of service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a few for NVIDIA VGPU and they affect Tesla too. There's also some that only affect Windows, this isn't a Linux-specific thing but a lot of them are just in their Linux drivers.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the good news is that drivers are already out that solve them. For GeForce users you want minimum driver versions 525.60.11, 515.86.01, 510.108.03, 470.161.03 or 390.157. For RTX, Quadro or NVS you want a minimum driver version of 525.60.11, 515.86.01, 510.108.03, 470.161.03 or 390.157. To put it very simply, if you're not using the very latest NVIDIA drivers in whatever series — update now, all previous versions are vulnerable to the drivers released on November 22nd.</p>
<p>Going by the bulletin page, the issues were public on November 28 but they've seemingly only just actually put out the security bulletin email.</p>

      <title>November&#39;s Steam Survey shows another uptick for Linux thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>November is over which means a fresh Steam Hardware Survey, and it continues the trend we've been seeing with the Linux user share rising and now it's bigger than ever.</p>
<p>At the end of November, Linux hit 1.44% on Steam against 2.45% on macOS and 96.11% on Windows. Going by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a>, where we've been tracking the Linux user share for a few years, it has hit another all-time high. The usual caveat of course: tiny compared to Windows, but the trend towards Linux is clearer than ever.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7184054341669971640gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7184054341669971640gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>This growth is easy to see is largely down to the Steam Deck, with SteamOS 3 being clearly the most popular way to play games on a Linux system now:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 25.77% + 0.79%.</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 64 bit 10.89% - 1.38%.</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.37% + 0.25%.</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 6.72% - 0.20%.</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.82% + 0.11%.</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21 64 bit 3.90% + 3.90%.</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 3.71% + 3.71%.</li>
<li>Other 33.81% - 7.18%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the Steam Deck is also the biggest device as a whole for Linux gaming with the AMD Custom GPU 0405 taking 25.77% + 0.76% with the next most popular being the AMD Radeon RX 480 3.75% - 0.15%. It's also interesting to see that SteamOS and the Steam Deck GPU percentages match in the Linux data, along with it not showing up on the Windows data at all making Windows on Steam Deck a tiny minority.</p>
<p><em>Edit: as also pointed out rightly so in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/novembers-steam-survey-shows-another-uptick-for-linux-thanks-to-steam-deck/comment_id=236133" target="_blank">comment</a>, since the Deck GPU shows up now in the combined platform data for all of Steam (AMD Custom GPU 0405 0.37% + 0.05%), we can see that nearly all are on SteamOS.</em></p>

      <title>The best Linux distribution for gaming in 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/12/the-best-linux-distros-for-gaming-in-2021/" target="_blank">Back in 2020</a> I pointed out what were the best Linux distributions for gaming, so here's the current state and what you should go for in 2023.</p>
<p>The thing is: not a lot has changed since my last article. Linux is still a minefield of many different distributions for people, and it can be very confusing. There's a lot of articles out there recommending really random and outdated distributions in lists too, so here's the real thing.</p>
<p>Without getting bogged down into packaging issues, and just giving you the basics of "this will work just fine" — go and install <strong><a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a></strong>. People will (and I expect them to) argue for others, and people are free to, but a lot of people suggest other distributions for the wrong reasons. Manjaro has too many problems both technical and management, Arch can and will break things if you don't know exactly what you're doing, Fedora is messy with NVIDIA drivers and SELinux on Fedora is a nuisance and so on. Ubuntu is still to this day, the most simple distribution of Linux to install and get gaming.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/66409371669912009gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/66409371669912009gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Ubuntu isn't perfect by a long shot, but it remains as my number 1 choice to suggest to people both new and old to get into Linux and get gaming. It's one of the most used on desktop by any statistic you can find, which also means troubleshooting it is generally easier too.</p>
<p>With the Ubuntu LTS (long term support) releases, you also get support for at least 5 years, so you don't have the hassle and potential breakage of major system internal updates for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Valve's own stats show Ubuntu as one of the most popular too and it has been the same since Steam came to Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6792767281669909890gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6792767281669909890gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>As a user of Fedora myself, take it from me if you're in any way new to Linux: just go with Ubuntu. If you ever decide you "really know Linux now", then you can think about using something else. Don't make it difficult for yourself.</p>
<p>How might this change in future?</p>
<p>Well, Valve are here with the Steam Deck and SteamOS. Eventually, Valve will release SteamOS 3 so anyone can download it and install it. That might end up being a good pick, but right now it's not on the table as it's not released and anyone making their own version of it (like HoloISO and others) are too small to recommend serious use of them.</p>
<p>If you need help and support, specifically for Linux and also Steam Deck gaming, you can try asking in our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/" target="_blank">Forum</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/0rxBtcSOonvGzXr4" target="_blank">Discord</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/irc/" target="_blank">IRC</a> and <a href="https://t.me/linux_gaming" target="_blank">Telegram</a>.</p>

      <title>Mesa 22.3 open source graphics drivers released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa 22.3 is the latest and greatest the open source community has to offer for graphics drivers, and it's now available with lots of improvements. Announced <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2022-November/225898.html" target="_blank">yesterday</a>, the open source drivers cover the likes of AMD, Intel, ARM and more on Linux.</p>
<p>For people concerned about stability and bugs, it's always best to wait at least for the first point release update to it like 22.3.1.</p>
<p>Newly supported extensions and features in Mesa 22.3 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>GL_ARB_shader_clock on llvmpipe</li>
<li>VK_KHR_shader_clock on lavapipe</li>
<li>Mesa-DB, the new single file cache type</li>
<li>VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout on RADV, lavapipe</li>
<li>VK_KHR_global_priority on RADV</li>
<li>GL_KHR_blend_equation_advanced_coherent on zink</li>
<li>VK_EXT_load_store_op_none on RADV</li>
<li>VK_EXT_mutable_descriptor_type on RADV</li>
<li>VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float on lvp</li>
<li>VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float2 on lvp</li>
<li>GL_NV_shader_atomic_float on llvmpipe</li>
<li>VK_EXT_image_robustness on v3dv</li>
<li>VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 on lavapipe</li>
<li>VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 on RADV &amp; anv</li>
<li>VK_EXT_pipeline_robustness on v3dv</li>
<li>Mali T620 on Panfrost</li>
<li>Shader disk cache on Panfrost</li>
<li>Support for R8G8B8, B8G8R8, R16G16B16 and 64-bit vertex buffer formats on RADV</li>
<li>Initial GFX11/RDNA3 support on RADV</li>
<li>Various ray tracing optimizations on RADV</li>
<li>ExtendedDynamicState2PatchControlPoints on RADV (VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2 feature)</li>
<li>Radeon Raytracing Analyzer integration (using RADV_RRA_* environment variables)</li>
<li>OpenGL 4.5 on freedreno/a6xx (up from 3.3)</li>
<li>VK_EXT_mesh_shader on ANV</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>RADV = AMD Vulkan Driver</li>
<li>ANV = Intel Vulkan Driver</li>
<li>Panfrost = Arm Mali Driver</li>
<li>V3DV = Raspberry Pi 4 Driver</li>
<li>Lavapipe = A CPU-based Software Vulkan driver </li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>Hopefully, later this month, I'll be looking to buy one of the new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/amd-announce-rx-7900-xtx-and-rx-7900-xt-plus-fsr3-teased/" target="_blank">AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX</a> so I can finally see what Mesa is like myself to use on desktop. </p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.0 is approaching release, future plans detailed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godot Engine 4.0 is so close now, with an overhauled and powerful Vulkan rendering system and now their developers have a new <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/release-management-4-0-and-beyond" target="_blank">blog post</a> up detailing some plans.</p>
<p>Right now they consider it "finally ready for production use" (but it's not out just yet) and they're keen to point out that "bugs and issues are inevitable" so regular bug fix releases will go up after. In the post from developer Clay John they point out that they do expect "users will encounter workflow-breaking bugs (especially on less common hardware), many workflows will feel unpolished, and performance won’t quite reach the goals we have set" which again follow-up releases will help clean up.</p>
<p>The good news is that for follow-up feature update release like 4.1, 4.2 and so on they plan to speed things up with quicker release cycles. For each big point release they will start merging new features, transition over to a period for just bug fixes, a release and then return back to merging in new features again. So they will get into a particular rhythm that should result in plenty of updates without such a long time in between.</p>
<p>For the first major point release in 4.1, they plan to focus on "stability, performance improvements, and usability".</p>
<p>When 4.0 does release, they say the Godot 3.5 "will remain the much more stable and battle-tested option" and they advise to continue using 3.5 until at least some of the 4.x releases.</p>
<p>So with the regular 4.0 Betas being released, they're getting it out the door when "it is ready to be used in production, not when it is perfect".</p>

      <title>Valve giving away tons of Steam Decks during The Game Awards 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>Top-down PvPvE Battle Royale game Gene Shift Auto now free to play on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After many years of development and going through multiple different names like Subvein, Mutant Factions and Gene Shift — the online mode has gone free to play as Gene Shift Auto. Offering a lot of fun for the price of nothing, this Native Linux game is inspired by Grand Theft Auto 2 for a lot of it.</p>
<p>There is a single-player (with co-op) that's a paid DLC but the main part of it being the online mode has been set free in Early Access.</p>
<p>Here's some footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CMrdRiQ0A_0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce173e71cdb1aab67e6b3cb55266f44c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CMrdRiQ0A_0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Gene Shift Auto has been in development since 2009, starting off as a hobby project under the name Subvein. When it was Greenlit for a Steam release in 2014, the sole developer - Ben Johnson of Nik Nak Studios - decided to take the game full-time. Sydney is expensive though, so he quit his job and set off to code in cheap youth hostels around the world, including 18 months living in Peru. This cheaper lifestyle allowed Ben to just scrape by and launch Gene Shift onto Steam Early Access on May 23rd, 2017. Now back in Sydney, Ben is finishing up the game in preparation for the full release.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

      <title>Two Point Campus: Space Academy announced for December 6th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Campus: Space Academy is the first expansion for the popular university building sim from the makers of Two Point Hospital. Releasing on December 6th it brings with it a whole universe of new features including three stellar campus locations, six student archetypes to welcome aboard, six far-out courses and classrooms and more.</p>
<p>Starting off in Universe City, you need to rebuild Two Point County's defunct space program and eventually sees you take up base on a suspiciously cheesy asteroid, and pillage it of its natural (and delicious) resources.</p>
<p>Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B1soHdxPLn4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ba34c479350e496cb7b5933643535ff.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B1soHdxPLn4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New classrooms like the Command Room will give your students the confidence to set phasers to stun, while the Battle Space will turn up the heat and let students duke it out with energy batons. You’ll need to attract (out of this) world class talent to fill your campus not only with burgeoning astronauts and space knights, but also alien students with a thirst for the forbidden knowledge of the galaxy...such as how Cheesy Gubbins are made.</p>
<p>It’s not a college without a party, and students will have ample opportunities with new events like hosting a sci-fi convention in your student union, watching the cosmic king of rock’n’roll, or joining a brand-new club with a time traveling twist. Two Point Campus is a charming university management simulator that tasks players with building and running the university campus of their dreams. From designing stylish dormitories to laying down ornamental pathways and gardens, players are given the freedom to pimp their Campus with new and easy-to-use creative tools to build their own educational masterpiece.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Releasing on December 6th for $9.99 / €9.99 / £8.99.</p>
<p>You can buy Two Point Campus on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/two-point-campus?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649080/Two_Point_Campus/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big release of the Transport Tycoon Deluxe inspired game OpenTTD is upcoming, with a <a href="https://www.openttd.org/news/2022/11/27/openttd-13-0-beta2" target="_blank">second Beta available</a> now with some great new features like variable interface scaling.

<li>Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry.</li>
<li>The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders.</li>
<li>An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system.</li>
<li>AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames).</li>

      <title>Portal with RTX releases on December 8th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lightspeed Studios and NVIDIA have announced that the Portal with RTX free DLC will be release on December 8th. It's only been announced with a Windows build, so for Linux you'll need to run it with Proton.</p>
<p>As a reminder: this is NVIDIA attempting to bring another little showcase example, like they did with Quake II RTX, although that one actually had a Native Linux build. It's free for owners of Portal with it adding in full ray tracing, new, hand-crafted hi-res physically based textures, and new, enhanced high-poly models. It also includes support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AZHBl5yWqJk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3884cf9fdd1738bfb1764726c4ec41f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AZHBl5yWqJk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This was made possible with their RTX Remix modding platform, that was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/nvidia-announces-ada-lovelace-their-3rd-generation-rtx-dlss-3-and-portal-rtx/" target="_blank">announced back in September</a> that makes use of DXVK to do a Vulkan conversion.</p>

<p>It can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2012840/Portal_with_RTX/" target="_blank">found on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher v2.5.0 is out with Downloads Manager, App Sideloading</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> v2.5.0 is out now for managing GOG and Epic Games Store, this new release has some pretty exciting features like sideloading.</p>
<p>The first big new addition is the Downloads Manager, allowing you to queue up many downloads. You can't yet change the download order, but it's a great start for a very useful feature.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2010961841669736038gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2010961841669736038gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can also now sideload anything. Heroic is no longer just for GOG and Epic Games. This means you can add any game or application on your PC, to launch inside Heroic. Not just that, Heroic is also now a Wine manager, allowing you to add and install various Windows-only games, launchers and more. It will even use SteamGridDB to pull in app images if it finds one for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17509371261669736161gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17509371261669736161gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>HowLongToBeat data was also added to game pages, if it can find it. So as you go through your library, you can see how long it might take you to play through. Another useful addition.</p>
<p>Other improvements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An option to automatically add new game installs to Steam.</li>
<li>Custom Theme support.</li>
<li>Notify you if the installed game is not available (e.g. from a drive not plugged in).</li>
<li>Show unsupported games - like Star Wars Squadrons on Epic not being supported as it needs EA app.</li>
<li>Improved performance in the UI in general, so some pages load without any delay now like the Game Page and the Install Modal.</li>
<li>Better online/offline system so Heroic can handle better when no network is available.</li>
<li>GamePad navigation was redone so now the Library Cards do not show any button and also the commands were changed to work exactly like the SteamOS for better familiarity.</li>
<li>Changelog will now be shown after Heroic is updated (or by clicking on Heroic Version on Sidebar), so you will be aware of all new features for that new release.</li>
<li>Login Screen was redesigned for a more modern look.</li>
<li>Added two new themes: Nord Light and Nord Dark.</li>
<li>It is now possible to force an installation even if Heroic detects no space left on the device.</li>
<li>Heroic will show a warning in case you are not logged in to a store and try to access it from the sidebar.</li>
<li>Updated Legendary and Electron to the latest versions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a little demo of how useful it is on Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>OpenRGB v0.8 adds support of a ton more devices to control RGB lights on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://openrgb.org/" target="_blank">OpenRGB</a> is a stellar open source project that aims to allow you to deal with all the various RGB lights your hardware comes with, as most vendors don't have apps for Linux. It's cross-platform so it works across Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>
<p>It's great not just because vendors don't support Linux officially (usually), but some vendors are often slow to update their apps and this puts them all under one roof instead of needing many apps for different lights.</p>
<p>Version 0.8 is out now and it's a big one. New features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Translation support
<ul>
<li>Automatically detect language from OS or manually select in settings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UI cleanup, frames around UI elements</li>
<li>Automatic udev rules generation</li>
<li>Improved AMD ADL I2C driver to support more AMD GPUs on Windows</li>
<li>Option to enable SMBus mutex in Windows for compatibility with other hardware management and RGB software that accesses SMBus.</li>
<li>Switched from inpout32 to WinRing0 low level access library. inpout32 is a great library, but Valorant's garbage anti-cheat attacks it while it is fine with WinRing0.
<ul>
<li>It is safe to remove inpout32.dll, you can follow the instructions here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/-/issues/669" target="_blank">#669</a> to do so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More Intel chipsets added to Intel SMBus detection</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that, a ton of new devices have been added in including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Many additional GPUs added to existing GPU controllers:
<ul>
<li>ASUS Aura GPU (Legacy)</li>
<li>ASUS Aura GPU (ENE)</li>
<li>Gigabyte RGB Fusion v1</li>
<li>Gigabyte RGB Fusion v2</li>
<li>EVGA GPU</li>
<li>MSI GPU</li>
<li>Gainward GPU</li>
<li>Palit/PNY GPU</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New GPU controllers:
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA Illumination (FE cards, Windows only)</li>
<li>Colorful GPU</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MSI-RGB controller improvements:
<ul>
<li>Additional motherboards added</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MSI Mystic Light controller improvements:
<ul>
<li>Additional motherboards added</li>
<li>Per-LED Direct mode on compatible boards</li>
<li>More modes re-enabled</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Razer controller improvements:
<ul>
<li>Additional devices added</li>
<li>Improved keymaps, unused slots no longer show as an LED</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SteelSeries controller improvements:
<ul>
<li>Additional devices added</li>
<li>Firmware version request</li>
<li>Improved keymaps</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Logitech controller improvements:
<ul>
<li>Additional devices added</li>
<li>Improved keymaps</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Stellaris 3.6 &#39;Orion&#39; is a big free update to many parts of the game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have put out the latest free update to their grand space strategy game Stellaris, the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/281990/announcements/detail/3516777336839176007?snr=1_2108_9__2107" target="_blank">3.6 "Orion" update</a> is less about new content and more about improving the game.</p>
<p>It does still have a small sprinkle of new content though like the new Galaxy Shapes including a 3 Arm Spiral Galaxy, 6 Arm Spiral Galaxy, Barred Galaxy, Starburst Galaxy, Cartwheel Galaxy and a Spoked Galaxy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6095473251669724596gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6095473251669724596gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - the new Spoked Galaxy type.</em></p>
<p>Other changes include new textures and shaders for Reanimated Leviathans, the ability for Hive Minds to choose a variation on the Reanimators Civic from the Necroids Species Pack and a fleet combat rebalance to address these issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Artillery Battleships dominate the late-game</li>
<li>Disengagement mechanics favor artillery battleships</li>
<li>Destroyers and Cruisers have extremely limited uses once the next ship size is unlocked</li>
<li>Command Limits are ineffective</li>
<li>Doomstacks aren’t fun</li>
</ul>

<p>They also reworked how the Ascension Paths from Utopia work, as well as added a new ascension path. There's a new Spiritualist Federation type to the specialized federation types from Federations, and added a new “Politics” tradition tree, which also requires Federations.</p>
<p>Additionally they added in new Orbital Ring buildings, which are included with the Overlord expansion.</p>
<p>For the base game they've added a new relic, accessibility improvements, new first contact events, included terraforming candidates on the galaxy map, added a new event chain, and tweaked some empire modifiers.</p>

      <title>Return to Monkey Island gets a GOG release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fans of GOG and adventure games will be happy, as the new <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/return_to_monkey_island" target="_blank">Return to Monkey Island</a> is now available on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/return_to_monkey_island" target="_blank">GOG</a>. The release comes with the Native Linux build too. Probably one of the most highly rated games of the year too, nice to see it didn't take long to come to other stores.</p>
<p>Released originally on September 19th, it gained the Native Linux build on October 25th.</p>
<p>Here's the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QW9NWLYhD00"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9b54529f30b433b2f751d1cf70f5e260.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QW9NWLYhD00" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"It’s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return to Point &amp; Click Swashbuckling</strong> - Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.</li>
<li><strong>Embark on Archipelago Adventures</strong> - Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.</li>
<li><strong>Created by a Legendary Crew</strong> - The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights &amp; Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).</li>

      <title>Steam Client Beta update has a few more New Big Picture Mode fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve continues working towards replacing the old Big Picture Mode with the UI from the Steam Deck, a few more fixes are in the new Steam Client Beta.</p>
<p>They still haven't fixed <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/8916" target="_blank">the bug</a> of it now not working at all on NVIDIA though, hopefully they will get to that before deciding to replace it completely. Quite annoying though, as I can't test it at all on my desktop now.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in the November 28th <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3504392437880389332" target="_blank">update</a>:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Linux driver 525.60.11 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today rolled out the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/196736/en-uk" target="_blank">525.60.11 driver</a>, following on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/nvidia-52553-beta-is-out-now-for-linux/" target="_blank">525.53 Beta</a> earlier this month. It is largely the same as the Beta, with a few extra fixes included and since it's not tagged as a Beta driver you should be all fine to upgrade to it.</p>
<p>Here's the full changelog, with the additions in this new release added in bold:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused Dynamic Boost to not engage on certain Ampere GPU based notebooks.</li>
<li>Added support for Dynamic Boost on notebooks with AMD CPUs.</li>
<li><strong>Improved the performance of PRIME render-offloaded applications.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fixed a regression that prevented Warp &amp; Blend from working correctly.</strong></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that resulted in stutter when moving windows in GNOME.</li>
<li>Added support for the EGL_MESA_platform_surfaceless extension.</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to prevent the creation of display layouts that exceed hardware size limitations when using the SLI Mosaic configuration page, and to display a warning if such a layout is created manually in the Display Configuration page.</li>
<li>Removed the hard dependency on GTK 2 when building nvidia-settings from source. nvidia-settings may now be built with support for GTK 2 only, GTK 3 only, or both GTK 2 and GTK 3.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed a bug which caused suspend to fail on systems running GNOME 3 as a Wayland compositor with NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations enabled.</strong></li>
<li>Updated the open kernel modules to support Quadro Sync, Stereo, rotation in X11, and YUV 4:2:0 on Turing.</li>
<li>Updated an error message that nvidia-installer displays when kernel header files cannot be found to print full paths for the missing files.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to use "command -v" in place of depending on"which" to determine the availability and location of certain tools.</li>
<li>Implemented support for over-the-air updates in the Proton and Wine NVIDIA NGX build. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the "PROTON_ENABLE_NGX_UPDATER" environment variable to a value of "1".</li>
<li>Updated the Vulkan driver so that the following extensions no longer depend on nvidia-uvm.ko being loaded at runtime:
<ul>
<li>* VK_KHR_acceleration_structure<br/>
* VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations<br/>
* VK_KHR_ray_query<br/>
* VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline<br/>
* VK_NV_cuda_kernel_launch<br/>
* VK_NV_ray_tracing<br/>
* VK_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur<br/>
* VK_NVX_binary_import<br/>
* VK_NVX_image_view_handle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to allow use of the "--add-this-kernel" feature by non-root users.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a more accurate progress bar when building the kernel modules.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a warning message if a Vulkan ICD loader is not detected.</li>
<li>Reworked nvidia-installer's support for DKMS: the kernel modules willnow be optionally registered with DKMS after the installer has already built and installed them on its own. nvidia-installer will now register the kernel modules with DKMS by default when the dkms(8) utility is detected on the system.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver which could lead to corruption ingeometry and tessellation control shaders.</li>
<li>Added a new CUDA Debugger implementation for Pascal and newer architectures as a part of the driver package: libcudadebugger.so (previously released separately as "CUDA GDB Developer Preview").</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to find incorrect fan speedranges on some GPUs.  Lower-level layers of the driver protected the hardware from programming incorrect fan speeds, so the symptom was only incorrect reporting.  Now, reporting in nvidia-settings matches what actually gets programmed in hardware.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression in 515.76 that caused blank screens and hangs whenstarting an X server on RTX 30 series GPUs in some configurations where the boot display is connected via HDMI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered would sometimes crashwith Xid 13 errors on Turing and later.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Half-Life: Alyx LEVITATION mod adds four hours of new story - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life: Alyx LEVITATION is an incredibly ambitious mod for Valve's amazing VR FPS and it's out now! To this day, Alyx remains as one of my all time favourite gaming experiences and so I've been eagerly awaiting more of it with this free expansive mod.</p>
<p>What it includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New story (3-4 hours in length).</li>
<li>New voicelines.</li>
<li>New character animations.</li>
<li>Eight challenging levels.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>LEVITATION starts right after the official story: Alyx returns to City-17, and teams up with Russell once again. During her absence, a mysterious levitating building appeared in the Sector X region of City-17. Two key members of the resistance named Barry and Maya decided to infiltrate and investigate Sector X -- until their signal went quiet... Now, Alyx must save her friends, and possibly the whole resistance.<br/>
<br/>
See the launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ualjhzxufpo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3c863e1ba8dcff26d70e37532b46a623.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ualjhzxufpo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can grab it from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2881604879" target="_blank">Steam Workshop</a>. It comes in 5 parts due to the size but you can subscribe to all at once.</p>
<p>Currently, it seems there's a bug where the AI can break at an excavator section. The developers are working on an official fix but there is a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830812479" target="_blank">workaround</a> you can use.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, Valve have still not fixed the issue with Alyx <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/332" target="_blank">not launching</a> on Linux with a "Timed out waiting for response from Mongoose" error that's been around since 2020. Thankfully, a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/332#issuecomment-1272934934" target="_blank">workaround</a> of temporarily disabling ipv6 enables it to launch again and I can confirm LEVITATION appears to work fine on Linux with Proton.</p>
