<p>Earlier in May, they updated their anti-cheat to BattlEye, whereas previously it used Easy Anti-Cheat. Both of which <em>can</em> be enabled to work on Linux platforms including SteamOS / Steam Deck. It seems in this case with the swap and the removal of the Native Linux build, the developer has decided <em>not</em> to enable BattlEye.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility page</a> was updated when the change happened.</p>
<p>In a post on Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/884660/announcements/detail/546735912086668872" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear players!<br/>
<br/>
We’d like to inform you that CRSED: Cuisine Royale is no longer supported on the Linux operating system.<br/>
<br/>
We apologize for any [inconvenience] and recommend switching to play on other available platforms.</p>

<p><em>Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified, so that will need to change soon.</em></p>
<p>Compared with the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends removing support</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online also shutting Linux out</a>, this is not quite the same kind of loss considering CRSED: Cuisine Royale barely hits 208 players online each day. Still, it does only further highlight the ongoing anti-cheat problem for Linux gaming. One issue I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/steamos-moving-from-steam-deck-to-more-handhelds-gives-me-hope-for-better-anti-cheat-compatibility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">truly hope Valve can solve</a> now that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3 has seen a wider release</a>.</p>

      <title>ACTION GAME MAKER devs exploring Linux support for the editor and exports</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ACTION GAME MAKER, the upcoming game making toolkit from Gotcha Gotcha Games (RPG Maker series) are exploring Linux support now. The tool is currently scheduled to release on Steam on June 17th.</p>
<p>Much like their previous tools, the idea is you don't need to write out lines of code. They say it "provides access to professional level functions without any programming required", with their previous game making kits being very popular tools. Their previous tools include Pixel Game Maker MV, RPG Maker MV, RPG Maker MZ, RPG Maker VX, RPG Maker 2000 and so on.</p>
<p>In an update posted on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2987180/announcements/detail/535477547601756842" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Linux Editor Support</h4>
<p>Due to a large number of requests, we have been testing both running the ACTION GAME MAKER editor on Linux as well as testing the Linux export function. As the tests are not finished yet, we will update everyone as soon as our testing is finished.<br/>
<br/>
However, we have confirmed that Wine or Proton can be used to run the Windows build on Linux without issue. Regardless, use of the Windows build on Linux is outside of official support – so proceed with caution!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This time around, it shouldn't <em>hopefully</em> be too difficult for them, since they're using <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> which is cross-platform and open source.</p>

      <title>Pixel-art RPG adventure Quartet releases August 26</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following a successful Kickstarter back in 2021, pixel-art RPG Quartet has a new trailer and release date set. The developers have confirmed a launch for Linux, macOS and Windows on August 26th.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of the classic JRPG style of retro games, this looks like one not to be missed. Great style to it and a fun list of features too.</p>
<p>About it: "A series of train robberies leads to evidence of a government conspiracy. A mysterious deck of cards gives a young girl a vision of another world. A fleet of deadly airships burns a path across the Imperial frontier. The world’s unlikeliest hero manifests tremendous magical power. These stories intertwine in the world of Quartet. Before it is all over, the eight heroes will uncover how a secret, centuries-old conflict literally reshaped the world. Then they will have their own decision to make about the destiny of magic.</p>
<p>Quartet begins with four separate stories, playable in any order. Those stories come together, giving the player a final party of eight characters. In combat, the player can deploy four of those characters at a time, with the ability to quickly swap in any of the four “reserve” characters. When a character swaps in, they immediately take their turn. While characters are in the reserves, they regenerate their AP at an enhanced rate. This allows clever players to hit the enemy with a never-ending stream of their best attacks, by swapping characters in at just the right moment."</p>
<p>There's also a full new trailer you can view below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YLGgByWNfe0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1dec3e77d76dc443c84cfe8acdd7cdf0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YLGgByWNfe0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Combat is fast-paced, turn-based, and full to the brim with TONS of special abilities to use. Each character and enemy turn are shown in the turn queue on the right, allowing the player to plan devastating and timely tactical strikes.</li>
<li>Players can unleash multiple elemental and physical abilities to exploit enemy weaknesses.</li>
<li>AP automatically regenerates after a hero's turn. So don't be stingy—spam those spells!</li>
<li>In Quartet, you control 4 characters on the front line, with the other 4 ready to jump into the action at any time. Ready to bring out your heavy-hitter or an emergency healer? Swap in seamlessly from the reserve party! Swapped-in characters take their turn immediately, with no penalty.</li>
<li>While characters are in the reserves, they also regenerate their ability points (AP) more rapidly, making swapping a crucial element of combat.</li>
<li>From the steampunk-inspired streets of Leornin to the forests on the barbarian frontier; from the cursed marshes of Tyche to the underworld warehouses of Seren, Quartet offers lots to explore.</li>
<li>Exploration is absolutely worth your while. With eight party members to equip, you need lots of gear, and a lot of it comes out of a treasure chest.</li>
<li>We have a hippo as a playable character.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Random chaotic puzzle-platformer Mosa Lina gets a big free expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mosa Lina is a crazy game, one that sometimes the levels don't exactly work right. It's all part of the fun in this random puzzle-platformer.</p>
<p>As the developer originally explained it: "This game is a response to the current trend of Immersive Sim design, where every ability is perfectly suited to solve a specific problem in the game. In order to counter this "Lock and Key" philosophy, Mosa Lina is aggressively random".</p>
<p>The Second Layer update brings 24 new tools, 189 new levels, 30 new boss level parts and 38 new music tracks. All in a free update to the game for all players. There's also 10 new languages supported too. You may want to grab it now while it's on sale until June 11th, when the price will go up. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HF4EJCYFUXE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8ab0edc26644ee50845aa3324d109f37.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HF4EJCYFUXE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game also recently had a Nintendo Switch port, with the level-editor working cross-platform so players on all platforms can play everything made by the community. Nice.</p>
<p>While they're saying (again) the game is actually done now, they still seem to plan some updates like more modding support and bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Kabuto Park is a short cosy bug-catching and battle game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Like collecting creatures but don't have a lot of time? Kabuto Park is the one for you. With a short overall run time at only a few hours and a cosy vibe, it's the perfect weekend game. It's out now with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The developer said to "Expect 2 to 4 hours of serene bug catching, exciting little battles and summer vibes". Offering simple game mechanics with catching bugs, little bug battles with deck-building gameplay and a light upgrade / level system to boost your favourites.</p>
<p>It's a smaller bite-sized game so it doesn't offer exploration or a big adventure. Short and sweet. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="33WncF0JPx4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7539dedff57fd1c296172e7ceb6ba2e1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/33WncF0JPx4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Coming from the same team that made Minami Lane and Froggy's Battle. </p>
<p>So far it's being well received on Steam with a Very Positive overall user rating.</p>

      <title>World of Goo 2 gets a rough level editor and Steam Workshop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2D BOY / Tomorrow Corporation have updated World of Goo 2 to include their developer level editor, along with Steam Workshop support.</p>
<p>Don't expect perfection though, they've been clear this was never planned to be released. In the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3385670/view/517462514506661937" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said: "We built the editor just for us, and did not originally plan to share it. It's unpolished, unsupported, and gloriously unbeautiful - but it built all the levels in World of Goo 2 - and now it's publicly available for brave players to build and share their own levels". They've updated the game to include it along with Steam Workshop support.</p>
<p>They also included a custom level highlight video from a player on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwlBIWKrVP4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a> to show off some of them.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OBS Studio 31.1.0 Beta 1 has been released for testing, bringing new features to the popular open source video recording and livestreaming app.</p>
<p>This release is a nice one for Linux users, since it brings Multitrack Video support, which was previously only available for Windows that came with the OBS Studio 30.2 released back in July 2024 so we've been waiting a while on it.

<li>Added support for hardware accelerated browser source to Linux [tytan652]
	<ul>
<li>The feature is disabled on NVIDIA GPUs due to feature-support inconsistencies across model series and driver series</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14793175151748603548gol1.jpg"><br/>

      <title>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS gets improved Intel GPU support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical recently announced Ubuntu 24.04 LTS has been upgraded to improve support for modern Intel GPUs. <em>This version of Ubuntu is supported until 31st May, 2029.</em></p>
<p>Writing in <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/advanced-intel-battlemage-gpu-features-now-available-for-ubuntu-24-04/61812" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official Ubuntu Discourse forum from Canonical developer Shane McKee, this is still only a Preview and so it does "not come with the same guarantees as the Ubuntu archives, is intended for testing and validation purposes only, and is not recommended for use in production environments".</p>
<p>A collaboration between Intel and Canonical to provide early preview of kernel and userspace support for new Intel GPUs with this introducing "comprehensive functionality enablement within userspace packages essential for AI, compute, and media stacks".</p>
<p>When testing it out you can find these improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Performance optimizations, updates, and bugfixes.</li>
<li>Introduction of the new CCS optimization in compute-runtime.</li>
<li>Enable debugging support for discrete Intel Xe GPUs.</li>
<li>oneAPI Level Zero Ray Tracing improves AI/ML workload speeds via Embree on SYCL.</li>
<li>Improved GPU + CPU ray tracing rendering performance in applications with Intel Embree support, such as Blender (v4.2+). Ray tracing hardware acceleration on the GPU gives 2x to 4x speedup for the ray tracing component of rendering and 20% to 30% improvement on the entire frame rendering.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Escape Simulator drops the Linux build to focus on supporting Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pine Studio released a new update for their popular game Escape Simulator, dropping the Linux version to focus on Proton.</p>
<p>In the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1435790/view/505077615531394446" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> originally their statement read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve decided to stop maintaining a native Linux build. With recent Steam Deck updates, we’ve encountered too many issues. The good news is the game runs great on Proton, and this allows us to focus on new content for everyone. Thanks to our Linux community for understanding ❤️</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they've since changed it to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve decided to stop maintaining a native Linux build. :( We supported the native Linux version for nearly 4 years, even though it’s always been under 0.5% of our players.<br/>
<br/>
Proton now runs the game more reliably than the native build with fewer crashes, better performance, and most Linux players already switched to it.<br/>
<br/>
As a small team, maintaining the native build across many distros was taking time away from developing new content (we just released our 50th room!). So we’ve decided to focus on supporting Proton, which continues to work well on Linux and Steam Deck.<br/>
<br/>
We understand this change is frustrating for some, and we truly appreciate everyone who supported us on Linux. &lt;3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's hard to argue against their reasoning. Proton runs Windows versions of games often incredibly well on Linux platforms, to the point you usually cannot tell the difference. It's only usually an actual problem if the game has some <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">annoying anti-cheat that blocks Linux</a>.</p>
<p>As for the new update it includes a new noir-themed room called Detective's Office, new detective outfits, a soundtrack update and they confirmed another DLC is on the way.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA stable driver 575.57.08 released for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released the new stable driver 575.57.08, as part of their New Feature Branch for Linux systems. This follows on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/nvidia-575-51-02-beta-driver-brings-nvidia-smooth-motion-support-to-linux-geforce-rtx-5060-series-announced/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">575.51.02 Beta driver released back in April</a>.</p>
<p>The full list of changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Highlights since R575 Beta Release, 575.51.02</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that led to increasing memory usage in X11 OpenGL and Vulkan applications after suspend/resume cycles.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications and compositors to stall when using NVIDIA as a PRIME Display Offload sink ("Reverse PRIME"), potentially resulting in a black screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Highlights from R575 Beta Release, 575.51.02</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended the __NV_DISABLE_EXPLICIT_SYNC environment variable, which was available to EGL applications, to also apply to GLX and Vulkan applications.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Marvel Rivals to crash on startup or when loading levels.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the applications that use the VK_KHR_present_wait extension to hang on Wayland.</li>
<li>Added support for GLX front buffer rendering on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Minecraft to crash on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented PRIME Render Offload from working correctly when using NVIDIA GPUs as both the render offload source and the render offload sink.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented VRR from working when overriding an EDID through the /sys/kernel/debug/dri/*/edid_override interface.</li>
<li>Added support for the DRM plane properties COLOR_ENCODING and COLOR_RANGE.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the Default TGP and Max TGP values from being reported in the nvidia-settings control panel while running notebook systems on battery power.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to display freezes on some systems when toggling Night Mode with GNOME on Wayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause graphics applications to not render correctly after a system suspend/resume cycle, if using the nvidia.ko kernel module parameter NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1.</li>
<li>Added a new kernel module parameter, 'conceal_vrr_caps', to the nvidia-modeset kernel module. This parameter may be used to enable usage of features on some displays such as ULMB (Ultra Low Motion Blur) which are incompatible with VRR. See the "Direct Rendering Manager Kernel Modesetting" (DRM KMS) chapter of the README for further information.</li>
<li>Added support for NVIDIA Smooth Motion. See the "NVIDIA Smooth Motion" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Extended the nvidia-powerd daemon to also support Dynamic Boost while a notebook is running on battery power. See the "Dynamic Boost on Linux" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-modeset driver to trim trailing whitespace from the product name passed to the GPU's audio device as part of the EDID-Like Data (ELD).</li>
<li>Dropped support for NV_PLANE_BLEND_CTM, NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_TF, NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_LUT, NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_LUT_SIZE, and NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_MULTIPLIER DRM plane properties on Linux kernels earlier than 6.8 to avoid exceeding DRM_OBJECT_MAX_PROPERTY.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause render-offloaded applications using KDE Frameworks 6 to crash.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve give Steam developer and publisher pages a little extra visibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have done a couple of small but useful tweaks to developer and publisher homepages, resulting in hopefully a little more visibility.</p>
<p>Don't know what I'm talking about? When you click a developer or publisher name on Steam, if developers have actually set them up, you'll go to their fancy page. They're actually pretty important for the reach of games, since anyone logged in on Steam can directly follow a page to get notifications about new game releases. Easy for players to keep track of their favourite developers and publishers.</p>
<p>Like this example below for Hooded Horse:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21138445341748536852gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Valve have tweaked the pages to enable developers to add various social media links, so they will show up at the top.</p>
<p>Additionally, these pages will also now show up every time you go through the checkout process on Steam, to show the pages for all the developers and publishers involved. Example below for 9 Kings (look to the bottom right):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6731095551748537046gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>On top of that, Valve made even it easier for developers to link games to these homepages so nothing gets missed. As developers set up a new store page for a new game, they can link them up right there whereas before it was an entirely separate page.</p>

      <title>REMATCH is working well on Linux / Steam Deck in the Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>REMATCH is an upcoming Football game from Sifu developer Sloclap, that feels very much like Rocket League but actual Football. <em>A Beta is live now on Steam which you can request access to via the Steam Playtest.</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, it appears that Easy Anti-Cheat is fully enabled for Proton so players on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck will be able to play. I've had no issues getting into games today to test it out. Which is great, because there's a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">number of popular games with anti-cheat</a> that block Linux platforms. REMATCH could easily be the next big multiplayer game, so this is awesome to see.</p>
<p>However, to keep expectations in check, this currently working status could change between the Beta and full release (we've seen that happen a few times). I did reach out to the developer and publisher and their PR team and no one has replied to me on it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EFMw23F-KbA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2448948162c80f1261086ef1efdb3431.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EFMw23F-KbA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) there's been no problems. It's incredibly smooth and looks great. A little challenging to learn though, quite a few different controls but genuinely seems like a lot of fun to play.</p>
<p>Playing it on Steam Deck with default (all Low) visuals, in a 3v3 match it seemed to keep a near solid 60FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11360347871748535293gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11360347871748535293gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Testing a 5v5 (the max player count) on Medium settings on Steam Deck, it was still surprisingly playable, although the performance was a fair bit lower at around 40-50FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1950780791748536171gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1950780791748536171gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully the anti-cheat will remain enabled once it's out fully on June 19th. Will keep you updated on any changes.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu gets monthly snapshot testing releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>To aid testing and ensure future Ubuntu (and Kubuntu etc) releases are in good shape, Canonical have announced monthly snapshots.</p>
<p>Canonical's VP of Engineering, Jon Seager, wrote a post on the official Discourse Forum going through the details. Talking about how things have changed with more rolling-release distros, immutable distros and so on with the goal here to "build a release process that takes advantage of modern release engineering practices, while retaining the resilience and stability of our six-monthly releases".</p>
<p>To be clear, they're <strong>not</strong> replacing their current normal releases, this is more about getting more automated testing done. However, it also makes it easier for testers to get their hands on upcoming releases for regular testing too.</p>
<p>As Seager said "Starting in May 2025, we’re introducing monthly snapshot releases for Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Ubuntu is not “moving to monthly releases” or adopting a rolling release model; we’re committed to our six-monthly releases with a Long Term Support (LTS) release every two years. That doesn’t mean that our release process should be exempt from the same scrutiny that the rest of our engineering processes are subject to."</p>
<p>As part of this, they've also recently formed a new 'Canonical Ubuntu Release Management Team' to help develop the process for all this to work alongside the main Ubuntu Release Team. Part of it is to help the team get away from "deep institutional knowledge, and toward clean well-documented automated workflows that are transparent, repeatable and testable". With their current model "failure modes are not detected until they’re urgent and blocking an imminent release" so this gives more opportunities to avoid that.</p>

      <title>GeForce NOW app for Steam Deck has arrived</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have today officially released their GeForce NOW native app for the Steam Deck, to give a better experience than using a browser with more features.</p>
<p>They said "The app is now available, and gamers can stream titles on the Steam Deck at up to 4K 60 frames per second — connected to a TV — with HDR10, NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Reflex technologies on supported titles. Plus, members can run these games at settings and performance levels that aren’t possible natively on the Steam Deck. To top it off, Steam Deck users can enjoy up to 50% longer battery life when streaming from an RTX gaming rig in the cloud."</p>
<p>This is for playing games you already own, or free to play games.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6tDvIATtQrI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bca08b4769b79722adcca54bcaa8bbf2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6tDvIATtQrI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To get it you need to be in Desktop Mode. Via the STEAM menu -&gt; Power -&gt; Switch to Desktop:</p>

<p><em>NVIDIA gave early access to a whole bunch of other sites but did not send anything to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Even though it has been announced and "released", the download page at time of writing has not been updated to the new app. So looks like they either forgot, or it's going to be updated sometime today. <em><strong>Update 2:24 UTC</strong> - the download link has now been corrected to the new app.</em></p>
<p>This will be really great for playing games where the developer has not enabled <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the anti-cheat</a>.</p>

      <title>Another dev gone, EA cancels Black Panther and closes Cliffhanger Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The rough time for the gaming industry continues, with a report that EA have cancelled the Black Panther game along with closing Cliffhanger Games.</p>
<p>Only recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-and-codemasters-no-longer-making-wrc-world-rally-championship-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EA's Codemasters also dropped the license</a> for the WRC games, with it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/fia-world-rally-championship-wrc-games-return-to-nacon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moving to NACON</a>. We also had the announcement recently where EA also cancelled <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-cancels-multiple-projects-from-apex-and-titanfall-developer-respawn-with-more-layoffs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multiple projects with layoffs at Apex developer Respawn</a>.</p>
<p>Another blow for a whole lot of developers, as per the report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a> who saw an email from EA Entertainment president Laura Miele. According to the email EA will focus mostly on a smaller set of franchises including Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends. That and their upcoming Iron Man game, another Star Wars: Jedi game and Mass Effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11880471741748524401gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I do hope the developers who now have to find another job will find something soon.</p>
<p>EA didn't respond for comment.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN launches today and works on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN arrives today by FromSoftware and thankfully it will work on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck even with the anti-cheat.</p>
<p>The game uses Easy Anti-Cheat and additionally also has GuardIT DRM and seems neither are causing any problems. It's now noted on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat page</a> so keep an eye on it for any changes. Our friends at <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/game-reviews/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDeckHQ</a> did an overview of it directly on Steam Deck. Really great to see such a big release working on Linux platforms.</p>
<p>Additionally, the developer has put up new trailers. One of which brings us back to the days of AMV's being super popular, with Evanescence:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ot6j_qqYQaM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0561beda19c77e988674c36fd51af1ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ot6j_qqYQaM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Are you going to be buying it? I don't play enough co-op games to make this one actually worth my time, so it's one I'm personally going to be skipping over. Also, I was never particularly fussed about ELDEN RING myself. Great design, but the punishing side of it just wasn't for me.</p>

      <title>Watchword gives the Balatro treatment to an anagram word game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Watchword is an anagram roguelike, pulling in some clear energy from Balatro as you play with words using rule-breaking synergies and combos. The game will have Native Linux and Steam Deck support, with a demo now available to try made with Godot.</p>
<p>I love how it's another game that takes a known genre of classics and twists it into something entirely new. The developer said how "A good vocabulary will certainly help, but it will mostly take careful planning and strategy to beat each trial" as you make crazy new words and try to fill up that score.</p>
<p>The demo worked perfectly for me on Kubuntu Linux (25.04). Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TaBdBq5k_PQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8467a6df66ff83e4e1159d2683e14fbb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TaBdBq5k_PQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full game features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>120+ Unique book relics</strong>: No two powers are the same. Add infinite repeat letters to words with "The Good Book" or focus on using new words with "Thesaurus". Each book has a unique strength that combos well with other books.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hundreds of piece variations:</strong> Every letter in the alphabet + custom bigrams (Two-letter tiles like QU, CH, or EE). You can even find mysterious Symbol tiles like "!", "?" or "&amp;" that have strange abilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>100,000+ Possible Watchwords:</strong> Try to spell a special word to expand the size of your board to make room for more powerful words in future trials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>20+ Watchguards</strong>: Each watchguard has a unique strategy to make their trial more difficult. Watch your wallet against the Greedy watchguard and make sure you plan ahead for the Patient Watchguard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>30+ run upgrades:</strong> Permanently upgrade your draws, discards, hand size, and much more!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Made-Up Words:</strong> Watchword is the only word game where you can make up words to fit your strategy. Find forbidden books that completely blow the dictionary wide open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check your stats and shoot for new high scores:</strong> Go infinite and see your high scores go into the hundred of billions of points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Endless replayability:</strong> Watch minutes become hours as you try to fit just <em>one</em> more word into your board and beat just<em> one</em> more run.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Retro dungeon crawler Brany Skeldalu gets a Linux version and source code re-release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gates of Skeldal (Czech: Brány Skeldalu) originally released in 1998 and recently it gained a Native Linux version along with a source code re-release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8965636621748429143gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The original MS-DOS game was ported to Windows back in 2005, then made freeware in 2007 with a source code release back in 2008. As of May 20th this year, they did a re-release of the source code as the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3533830/view/507328875549689075" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gates of Skeldal source code has now been released under the MIT license.<br>
<br/>
This isn't entirely new, as the source code was publicly available even before its Steam release, but we hope this formal release will help increase its reach.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/ondra-novak/gates_of_skeldal" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ondra-novak/gates_of_skeldal</a><br/>
<br/>
Now you can modify the game, improve it, help with bug fixes and testing, compile it on all sorts of weird hardware, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that only the source code is released under the MIT license, not the graphics, game design, sound, or other assets, and definitely not the brand!</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few days later, a Linux version was then released on Steam too. Nice little win for game preservation.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explore the Mysterious Island of Rovenland</strong></p>
<p>This mythical island is home to the ruins of ancient civilizations, treacherous dungeons, and forgotten temples brimming with magic. Journey through icy caverns, the heart of a volcano, and the windswept peaks of the Stormy Mountain. The fate of the world hangs by a thread—five rogue mages are trying to open a gate to the forbidden dimension of Zohar. Can you stop them before it's too late?</p>
<p><strong>Assemble Your Party and Engage in Tactical Turn-Based Combat</strong></p>

      <title>SteamOS massively beats Windows on the Legion Go S</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>According to YouTuber Dave2D who managed to get their hands on the Lenovo Legion Go S, the SteamOS version destroys Windows in performance and battery life. That's a nice win for Valve's Linux platform, and only continues to show how drastically Linux has improved thanks to all the work on GPU drivers and the Proton compatibility layer.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release of SteamOS 3.7</a>, this has only just begun. We're about to see a lot more of this.</p>
<p>Have a look at the performance difference and this is just on the Z2 Go chip as well:</p>

<p>When it comes to battery life, SteamOS was yet again a <em>very</em> clear winner in this with even demanding titles like Cyberpunk 2077 having 1 hour 31 minutes on Windows and 1 hour 54 minutes on SteamOS. In less demanding titles like Dead Cells the difference is absolutely insane jumping from 2 hours 47 minutes on Windows to 6 hours 12 minutes on SteamOS. Again for Hades at only 1 hour 58 minutes on Windows and 4 hours 17 minutes on SteamOS.</p>
<p>Dave2D also talks again about just how good the sleep system is on SteamOS, with you being able to just tap the power button on the Legion Go S and tap it again to pick up right where you left off which just doesn't really work on Windows. Seems like it's just win after win for SteamOS compared to Windows for handheld gaming (apart from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">games with anti-cheat</a>).</p>
<p>See their full video on it below, Dave2D does some really nice work:</p>

<p>I did ask Lenovo if we would be able to get a review unit but the emails didn't really go anywhere, so it seems most likely we will not be getting one.</p>

      <title>Steam Workshop support comes to Civilization VII in June with a new update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis are still working to improve Civilization VII, with a big update coming in June and a smaller update out now. Recently, the game unfortunately hit Mostly Negative on all the recent reviews, so they've got their work cut out for them.</p>
<p>For the June update, it's going to be a big one and includes lots of features that really should make more players happy with it. Some of what they've revealed includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Large &amp; Huge Map Support.</li>
<li>Steam Workshop Support.</li>
<li>Improved Game Setup Options.</li>
<li>New Religious Beliefs and Balance.</li>
<li>New City State Bonuses and Balance.</li>
<li>New Town Specializations and Balance.</li>
<li>Specialist Balance.</li>
<li>Treasure Fleet Improvements.</li>
<li>UI &amp; Quality-of-Life Improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17374843851748427612gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>With the v1.2.1 update that's <em>out now</em> there's a Linux and macOS fix noted "Adjusted rendering resolution when launching in fullscreen mode" and for Steam Deck they "Addressed reported UI issues during multiplayer games". On top of some new features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pangaea Plus Map Type</strong></p>
<p>Added a new map type: Pangaea Plus. This map type features a single large central landmass that all civs start on. Surrounding islands are Distant Lands to all players and are home to Treasure Resources in the Exploration Age.</p>
<p><strong>Increased Multiplayer Player Limit</strong></p>
<p>Increased the maximum number of human players on all maps in Antiquity and Exploration. The max number of players in these ages now matches the number in Modern. Max human player numbers in Antiquity and Exploration are now (Tiny: 4; Small: 6; Standard: 8).* Note that the Standard map size is not available on Nintendo Switch, but the expanded player counts for Tiny and Small map sizes do apply.</p>
<p>Dev note: Players who would not fit on the Homelands are instead spawned in the Distant Lands and can make progress to the Legacy Paths in Antiquity and Exploration. Their progress is now tracked in the Legacy Path screen.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The big cross-over mod Lambda Fortress that puts the Team Fortress 2 mercenaries into Half-Life 2 and other Source campaigns is coming to Steam. More goodies thanks to Valve releasing TF2 code into the Source SDK.</p>
<p>I'll admit I must live under a rock when it comes to certain bigger Valve game mods, because I've never heard of it until now and it sounds hilarious. From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lambda Fortress is a mod for Team Fortress 2 that brings the mercenaries to the gritty world of Half-Life 2 and other Source Engine Campaigns! Play solo or cooperatively across iconic worlds with a unique twist.</p>
<p>Fight your way through City 17, have a lunch break on the coast, or race to White Forest all with your friends!</p>

      <title>Splitgate 2 now works on Desktop Linux with the anti-cheat updated</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a surprise. 1047 Games recently launched the free to play Splitgate 2 in Beta on Steam, initially with their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/splitgate-2-gets-a-beta-on-steam-works-on-steam-deck-but-not-other-linux-systems-for-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat RedKard blocking Desktop Linux</a> but allowing the Steam Deck with SteamOS. Now they've tweaked it to allow Desktop Linux players in.</p>
<p>They've been dealing with some big server issues since the May 22nd launch, which seems to be getting smoother now.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2918300/discussions/0/599653731153219060/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam titled "The State of Splitgate 2" they noted these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Purchases have been restored &amp; the system is working<br/>
- If you're still missing items contact Support (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.splitgate.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">http://support.splitgate.com</a>)<br/>
- XP is now active (we've also turned on Double XP)<br/>
- Sometimes XP is delayed but it is still going through<br/>
- The Beta now supports players on Linux thru Proton<br/>
- We're working on a Free Survivor Pack for all Beta Players (more info to share in the coming days)<br/>
- Challenges are our next priority, when they're back up, we'll be increasing the tickets earned so people can still complete the Battle Pass in time<br/>
We're still working hard, &amp; we won't stop until we make things right. Thanks for your feedback, patience &amp; continued support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing out the Beta on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) with the latest Proton 9.0-4, there was no mouse movement in matches but a controller did work. However, mouse movement did work in the menus, so that's an odd one.</p>

      <title>Play as a virus inside Winnie the Pooh in Winnie&#39;s Hole - demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Pooh now in the public domain, of course we're going to get some weird Winnie the Pooh games. Winnie's Hole sounds a bit…you know, but it's actually a clever sounding game from Twice Different who made Ring of Pain.</p>
<p>Here you're fighting Winnie from within, as a virus attacking the body and mind. Poor old Pooh. You use various blocks to spread a virus in randomly generated inner worlds. The developers say it's a "union of fast-paced, turn-based gameplay which looks beyond common roguelite conventions to create a challenging new format". Additionally they say it's a "Holesome dark comedy inspired by old-school Nickelodeon cartoons" that is actually a "charming, original story with characters inspired by A.A. Milne’s classic Winnie the Pooh reimagined in a world of dark science, and styled like a Brothers’ Grimm fairytale made by Nickelodeon with an unhealthy serving of Cronenberg body horror".</p>
<p>Alrite, you've sold me.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Evolve with each run - Unlock new Perks, Mutations and Virus Strains.</li>
<li>Mutate your host as a symbiotic virus.</li>
<li>Bodybuilding in the worst way.</li>
<li>A storybook narrative which reimagines Winnie in a world of dark science.</li>
<li>A fresh take on exploration, replacing the typical roguelite node map with strategic, turn-based building using a set of tetromino-like virus blocks which you can evolve and reshape.</li>
<li>Dynamic battle system where each turn is an action combo for fast-paced gameplay.</li>
<li>Holesome horror comedy with gritty art inspired by old school Nickelodeon and Brothers' Grimm fairytales.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've tested the demo working great on Desktop Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. It's thoroughly weird but actually quite funny, as well as being ever so slightly horrifying on what they've done. Interesting game mechanics though</p>

      <title>FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) games return to NACON</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the news recently that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-and-codemasters-no-longer-making-wrc-world-rally-championship-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EA Codemasters were pausing development</a> plans on future rally titles, we now know who will continue the series with it being back with NACON.</p>
<p>NACON are no stranger to the series, with them now owning KT Racing (Kylotonn) since 2018 who developed multiple entries in the series from WRC 5 to WRC 10 and WRC Generations. Their new license gives them control from 2027 through 2032 and they will now begin developing an all-new WRC game series that will have official rallies, vehicles, teams, drivers, and sponsors and will be a "complete reboot of the franchise".</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to renew our collaboration with WRC Promoter. This iconic license provides an exceptional playground to build a highly refined driving experience that lives up to the expectations of rally fans,” said Alain Falc, CEO of NACON. “Between 2015 and 2023, we had the opportunity to work closely with the championship’s official teams and many drivers, allowing us to gain solid and unique expertise in translating rallying into a video game experience. This new venture marks a major milestone: a fully reimagined project driven by a passionate and specialized team, with a clear ambition to elevate rally games to new heights.”</p>
<p>“After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with NACON,” expressed FIA World Rally Championship’s Chief Marketing Officer Arne Dirks. “Their vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned.

      <title>Indie puzzle game Cogs from 2009 gets a remaster</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cogs from Lazy 8 Studios originally released back in 2009, and gained a Native Linux version back with the Humble Indie Bundle 3 in 2011. Now, 16 years or so later, the developer has give it a small remaster. <em>This is all starting to make me feel really old now. The third Humble Indie Bundle was really 14 years ago?</em></p>
<p>In a news post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/26500/view/542231772987917376" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> titled "Cogs Remastered!" the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recently took some time to port Cogs over to an entirely different code base -- from a custom C++ engine I wrote 16 years ago to C# on Unity. Thanks to a few folks on the forums who have helped me hunt down some launch-day bugs and encouraged me to support the legacy Cloud Save data.<br/>
<br/>
This version should be better in just about every way -- snappier, higher-resolution, and more aligned with modern APIs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the original trailer below:</p>

<p>A little about the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cogs is a puzzle game where players build machines from sliding tiles. Players can choose from 50 levels and 3 gameplay modes. New puzzles are unlocked by building contraptions quickly and efficiently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inventor Mode:</strong> Starting with simple puzzles, players are introduced to the widgets that are used to build machines  gears, pipes, balloons, chimes, hammers, wheels, props, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Time Challenge Mode:</strong> If you finish a puzzle in Inventor Mode, it will be unlocked here. This time, it will take fewer moves to reach a solution, but you only have 30 seconds to find it.</li>
<li><strong>Move Challenge Mode:</strong> Take your time and plan ahead. Every click counts when you only get ten moves to find a solution.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SteamOS Manager for BIOS updates, TDP and GPU clock controls now open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>On Valve's official public GitLab, they've recently put up SteamOS Manager under the open source MIT license following the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.7 release</a> for more devices.</p>
<p>What is it? SteamOS Manager is a "system daemon that aims to abstract Steam's interactions with the operating system". Valve's goal with it is to "have a standardized interface so that SteamOS specific features in the Steam client, e.g. TDP management, can be exposed in any linux distro that provides an implementation of this DBus API".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the features it enables includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPU clock management.</li>
<li>TDP management.</li>
<li>BIOS/Dock updates.</li>
<li>Storage device maintenance tasks.</li>
<li>External storage device formatting.</li>
<li>Max battery charge level.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>And more.</em></p>
<p>Seems like this will be useful for other hardware vendors to hook up and test SteamOS integration. And probably other Linux distributions aimed at handhelds too (Bazzite, ChimeraOS and so on).</p>
<p>Here's the fun thing: in their full specification, it includes a feature named "EnterDownloadMode" which the code comments notes, "Enter a low power mode for downloads and get a handle that will keep this mode active until all obtained handles are dropped".</p>
<p>It's not clear if this is something used by SteamOS already, or if it's the feature that has been requested by Steam Deck owners again and again and again to download while the screen is off (sounds like it could be related). I've emailed Valve to see if they want to comment on that.</p>

      <title>Into the Restless Ruins gets you to deck-build a dungeon and then explore it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Into the Restless Ruins is a rather different dungeon crawler, one where you build the dungeon over time with a deck of cards you continue to gather and upgrade.<em> Disclosure: key provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>Inspired by Scottish folklore, what you get is a thoroughly interesting experience when it comes to the exploration, since you start off with nothing but a single blank exit room and a few dungeon room cards. You place down these cards to build the dungeon to explore, with many of them having different functions to help you (like healing, increasing your damage etc). As you explore your torchlight gradually fades, making it more difficult to explore since there's no mini-map so you have to learn your own layout.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13080620971748276814gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13080620971748276814gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That torch I mentioned? You need to get out of the dungeon and back to the initial exit room before it completely goes out or you're a bit screwed as the darkness will rapidly drain your health. So it's also in part an extraction game, with you running around your creation to collect and explore, before getting back to the exit, to then build even more.</p>
<p>The idea here is that you start off with a limited space to build, as you're trying to connect up your rooms to various special areas with a Seal inside that allow you to unlock more of the map to continue build up towards the end of the level. As you progress you unlock more and more cards and eventually you can upgrade your cards as well. Some upgrades give cards more doors to make connecting them all up easier, other upgrades will increase the buff you get from certain special rooms. Like a Campfire room, that adds more time to your torch to explore further.</p>
<p>When you extract from a run each time, you gradually build up a corruption meter, which ends up giving you curse cards which can make things a little bit more challenging. So you do want to explore as far as you can, as quickly as you can in as little runs as possible. If you meter gets full, it's also game over.</p>
<p>It's also an auto-battler. As you run around your dungeon various enemies will spawn and come floating towards you, with your character auto-attacking them all. As you take down enemies, you collect XP in a Vampire Survivor-style progression system which gives you an additional card on level-up.</p>
<p>The combat in it is where the game falls pretty <em>flat</em>, because it's really quite lifeless and <em>uninteresting</em> which is a shame. All that matters for the combat is your positioning, since you swipe most enemies away automatically with a single auto-swing of your weapon. Once you get another weapon, it makes it even easier, there's just pretty much no challenge at all to the combat. If they had expanded this even just a little bit, the game would have been vastly better. As it is, the combat is so simple it's <em>boring</em>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YGWr9wCshho"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/05a534a576ae7e72fd3edb035f40034e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YGWr9wCshho" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's another problem big with it though. As much as I truly like the dungeon creation, you can <em>break</em> the game entirely with it and have to restart. There's no way to remove a room you've placed, so if you accidentally block access to one of the special Seal rooms and carry on building and exploring, you'll have to just restart since that is the only way to expand the map and keep going. The developer said you just need to avoid that, but to me that's simply <em>not good enough.</em> If the game allows you to get completely progression blocked - that's simply bad design and feels like it wasted my time when that happened.</p>
<p>I <em>love</em> the dungeon creation side of it. The way you build up a deck and then craft the dungeon to explore, along with the torchlight mechanic make it quite a challenge and it is a genuinely great set of game mechanics. Aside from the progression blocking issue (that they really should sort). It's also let down by lifeless combat. So overall I don't really recommend it. Some nice ideas and I get their vision for it but not good enough on the implementation of them.</p>
<p>Into the Restless Ruins perfectly on Desktop Linux / SteamOS with Proton. Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>3rd person narrative horror MEGANAUT from the dev of Lorn&#39;s Lure gets a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of the exploration climbing game Lorn's Lure is working on a new game named MEGANAUT, a 3rd person narrative horror and now there's a demo available with Linux support.</p>
<p>It's set in the same universe as Lorn's Lure and while the setting is quite different being a horror game, it also brings its own unique floating movement mechanic. From the press details I was sent they said it's "Inspired by Dead Space's zero gravity sections and Abzu's swimming mechanics; it allows for the slower paced tension of horror, combined with the 3D traversal that the megastructure affords".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EzM92ffKk7o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/698ec543431f49cf658d05028c03c432.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EzM92ffKk7o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About the full game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your friend Seija, went too far beyond the habitat walls and is now missing in the deep structure.</p>
<p>As a Scavenger, you have some expertise beyond the walls.</p>
<p>You volunteer to search for him.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Float through a mysterious megastructure with <strong>6 degrees of freedom.</strong></li>
<li>Thick with oppressive and <strong>creepy atmosphere.</strong></li>
<li>Simple environmental <strong>puzzles that don't take you out of the atmosphere.</strong></li>
<li>Some <strong>jump scares.</strong></li>
<li>Discover <strong>deep lore</strong> beyond the main story arc.</li>
<li>Concise experience, roughly<strong> 2-3 hours of play time.</strong></li>
</ul>

      <title>The Elder Scrolls: Arena remake gets Jolt Physics and big new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OpenTESArena is an in-development open source game engine remake of The Elder Scrolls: Arena, with a big new release out now as the developer continues working towards making it actually playable.</p>
<p>Being fully playable is still a while away though, going by their current progress a lot of the main gameplay mechanics simply haven't been put in yet. Another fun project for preserving another classic though.</p>
<p>Speaking about the release the developer said: "This release brings greatly-improved player movement thanks to the addition of <a href="https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Jolt Physics</a>. The player can now climb out of chasms, jump, and swim. Other baseline gameplay features such as hit registering, killable enemies (w/o AI), item pickup, and using keys on doors allow the starting dungeon to now be considered minimum-playable. Rendering performance is still below average and more optimizations are planned."</p>
<p>Check out their release overview video below:</p>

      <title>After their publisher was banned from Steam, Bioprototype returns and it&#39;s free</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometime in 2024 a publisher called BD Games was banned from Steam, taking with it numerous smaller games. Bioprototype from Emprom Game recently returned to Steam without a publisher, and it's free to claim and keep for a while.</p>
<p>In a post on Steam the developer explained a bit more about situation, apologizing for their own poor handling of it, and so to make up for it the game is free to claim and keep until July 20th while they work on the sequel Bioweaver.</p>
<p>What is it? A Vampire Survivor-like auto-shooter with a unique evolution system where you add and change your organs to keep on getting stronger. You end up chaining together various different types of abilities, that all work together to build up some seriously crazy attack-patterns. It's definitely an interesting take on the survivor-like genre and worth a go. The amount of customization you get from it is quite impressive.</p>

      <title>Brickadia is like Roblox and LEGO combined and it arrives July 11</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Brickadia has been an interesting project to follow, that combines some elements of Roblox with powerful creation systems along with an LEGO styled building system to create all sorts of things. They just announced that it's going to enter Early Access on July 11th.</p>
<p>More about: "Brickadia is a next-generation sandbox game with immense flexibility. Every creative tool - building, scripting, and more - is used right in the game, in real-time multiplayer. Build massive worlds, intricate physics contraptions, and entirely new game modes together with your friends without ever leaving the action."</p>
<p>Check out their new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RPAnrTAAjMM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc961351e06b1347155f7fa84c95d532.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RPAnrTAAjMM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In regards to Linux support, they decided to <em>drop</em> the Native Linux version and instead rely on Valve's Proton compatibility layer. I spoke with their team over email who mentioned to me they removed the Linux version "not because we don’t want to support Linux, but because running the Windows version through Proton performs vastly better". They continued "We didn’t want people to use the native version, expecting it to be better, only to get a much worse experience just because Epic hasn’t bothered to optimize their Vulkan renderer". So it's again a problem of the game engine, Unreal Engine, just not having great Linux support.</p>
<p>As for any <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> annoyances, they told me "The game runs great on a Steam Deck and we’re planning to support it on Early Access launch. There won’t be anti-cheat, it’s not a competitive game" and that they're not going to do anything to break Proton support intentionally.</p>

      <title>An Amazing Wizard is a Dead Cells-like where you mix spells out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out now in Early Access with Linux support, An Amazing Wizard brings an interesting spell mixing system to a Dead Cells-like action platformer. <em>Disclosure: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>The initial release seems really promising after playing through a fair bit of it, and I really do enjoy mixing together all sorts of spells to make something completely ridiculous. The game is frantic and fast but very clearly takes a lot of the world design from Dead Cells.</p>
<p>You run through each generated area of platforms stitched together as you try to get through all the different doors, while smashing through all the enemies in your way to find new spells and combine them. Then face off against huge boss monsters and just keep upgrading as much as you possibly can. If you die, you return to a special area to do other meta upgrades and challenges, to run do a fresh run of combining spells and fighting monsters again.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mqzMXPyUvIE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4cc14a0c8899ce3c5b12f97836db89b7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mqzMXPyUvIE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I do like what I'm seeing, but there's just a little something about the combat that makes it feel nowhere near as satisfying as the likes of Dead Cells, but I can't put my finger on exactly what. The combat isn't bad, just not terribly exciting either. It's less about the combat, and more about just blasting your way through to become as stupidly powerful as possible, so in that way it's more akin to the survivor-like games that have appeared wearing the skin of Dead Cells.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLD - Explore a unique world every time you play.</li>
<li>ACTION ROGUEVANIA - This means permanent deaths where you lose everything you have found, but there are lots of permanent upgrades available.</li>
<li>200+ PERMANENT UPGRADES - Upgrade your starting items or statistics, add more elements to the world, increase your chances of finding better items and many more!</li>
<li>7 PLAYABLE ELEMENT WIZARD – Wheel the power of seven unique elements, each offering distinct abilities and combinations to match your playstyle.</li>
<li>ENCHANT YOUR SPELLS - Search for Astral Forges to add enchantments to all your Spells and Magic Weapons to add some special effects to them!</li>
<li>200+ UNIQUE ARTIFACTS - Every artifact has it's own special use. A lot of them change your Basic Spell behavior or add special abilities. Literally countless combinations.</li>
<li>120+ POWERFUL SPELLS - Cast Fire Balls or Tornados, Summon Creatures, Slow Time, Create Gravity Zones and many, many more...</li>
<li>DOZENS OF MAGIC WEAPONS - Use one of many Magic Weapons to help you survive!</li>
<li>50+ CHALLENGES - Test your skills by completing the trials of the Goddess of Death!</li>
<li>5 NONLINEAR LEVELS - Only 5 levels? Yes, but each time you die you will respawn in one of the four nature-inspired worlds and face other enemies based on the current biome. Levels order is never the same!</li>
<li>FEW DIFFICULTY LEVELS - Every time you kill the end boss, you will gain the possibility to change the difficulty level and face stronger foes.</li>
<li>MANY BOSSES - After every level you will have to face a merciless boss.</li>
<li>LEVEL UP YOUR CHARACTER - Gain Experience Points for killing enemies. Select one of dozens of perks after leveling up to make you even stronger!</li>
<li>A LOT OF SECRETS AND MYSTERIES TO DISCOVER - No spoilers!</li>
<li>HOURS OF FUN - This one depends on your skill. Something about 50 - 80 hours or even more!</li>
<li>MULTIPLE SAVE SLOTS</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I should note that the developer has been using generative AI. The Steam page notes "A portion of the Steam community assets and marketing materials are generated using AI". Speaking to the developer, they told me previously they also used an AI voice in the game but they have since removed it and so "Nothing in the game is AI" now.</p>

      <title>CoreCtrl app has entered maintenance mode with no new features coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CoreCtrl is a popular Linux app designed to let you get more control over your GPU and CPU. Sadly, the creator has put it into maintenance mode with no new features coming.</p>
<p>Recently the official readme on <a href="https://gitlab.com/corectrl/corectrl" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitLab</a> was updated to note "CoreCtrl is in maintenance mode. This means no new features or hardware support will be added, and development will focus solely on bug fixes and maintenance-related changes".</p>
<p>So it will continue working with all the features it has but may not work with any upcoming hardware. A shame, as it has some great features but since it's open source anyone could decide to fork it and continue it on like we've seen with various other projects in the past.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental update enables gamepad input for all game launchers on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a brand new and exciting update to Proton Experimental for Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck gamers. This brings some new fixes, as well as an interesting change for their Xalia integration.</p>
<p>Xalia, if you've not heard of it, is an open source tool that brings a gamepad UI for traditional desktop applications. Especially useful for Valve's Proton, since it can make working with launchers on Steam Deck, SteamOS and any Linux system playing games via Steam Big Picture Mode a lot simpler since you won't need to change any inputs. It's not just launchers though, some games have prerequisite installation steps which Xalia enables you to click through with a gamepad too.</p>
<p>For quite a few releases Valve have been tweaking how they use Xalia, gradually adding more supported games and updating Xalia itself from the upstream project. However, the Proton Experimental update for May 23rd simply enables it by default now. So it's not set on specific games, as Valve feel it's at a point where it will "work with most launchers using builtin Win32 controls".</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wider release of SteamOS 3.7</a> for more devices, this seems like a great step for Windows game compatibility.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">All the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enabled NVAPI for The Last Of Us 2.</li>
<li>Fixed games not starting when upgrading from a removed Proton installation.</li>
<li>Enabled <a href="https://github.com/madewokherd/xalia/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Xalia</a> by default instead of only for selected titles. It should work with most launchers using builtin Win32 controls.</li>
<li>Improved situation with Once Human having bad stutter on certain setups.</li>
<li>Fixed Black Desert launcher rendering all black on Nvidia + Wayland setups.</li>
<li>Fixed Dead Island 2 not detecting Epic Online Services and not allowing cross-play.</li>
<li>Fixed Cornerpond not rendering transparency correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed Monster Jam Showdown not being able to link Epic Games account.</li>
<li>Fixed The First Berserker: Khazan displaying driver version warning with Intel and Nvidia GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed DLSS frame generation options being disabled in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</li>
</ul>

      <title>StarVaders is deck-building meets grid-based tactics and it&#39;s basically perfect</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>StarVaders from developer Pengonauts is a colourful and action-packed mix of a deck-builder with fast grid-based tactical combat and it's a thoroughly great time. I've never seen another game so smoothly blend these two together. <em>Disclosure: key provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>Here you pilot a mech to fight off swarms of alien invaders across a rogue-lite campaign, and the tight design of it shines right on through. It's a game that doesn't take you particularly long to blast through either at about an hour a run, which is part of what makes it so great. That, and just the overall fab design of it with multiple characters and lots of ways to build up your decks. Even the tutorial was good in this, with it getting you right into the action!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hd_wWZvVCNI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/08e56a3e2daef0f5c1ef69fdde429030.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hd_wWZvVCNI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The combat, while challenging, is not overly punishing. However, it definitely is a tough one to get through even on the initial difficulty level with the first character. But, there's tons of features and little touches that make it worth pushing through. Getting hit by enemies for example won't end up destroying you, not directly anyway, as you just build up useless junk cards in your pile.</p>
<p>Your main things to worry about are how many turns you've used, since most battles have a turn limit and how far down the grid the enemies are getting, which is the main point of the combat. These aliens are trying to get closer and closer, moving a step each turn and It's your job to use up all your cards and move around the grid to prevent that. If the invaders manage to get to the bottom 3 rows you'll start to build up Doom, if you build up too much Doom it's all over. Doom carries over between missions too, which is where a lot of the challenge comes in. If you hit the turn limit, enemies will build up Doom no matter where they are — so you need to take them out fast.</p>
<p>With lots of different enemies that have different abilities, strengths and weaknesses along with the boss battles that are their own little mini-game due to the boss creatures having their own special mechanics it sure does keep you on your toes.</p>
<p>Enemies have a big mixture of behaviours between shooting at you, spawning more enemies or obstacles, shields you need to take down first (with some becoming invulnerable the turn the shield goes down), firing rockets across a whole area making them hard to avoid and so on. There's lots to think about but it's never overloading on your brain.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14724096921748009369gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14724096921748009369gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10939017671748009371gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10939017671748009371gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I especially love how clear and accessible the game is to get to grips with thanks to the neat design. The battles are all across a small grid, and you can hover over anything to get a readout on what it is (including enemies and their abilities). On top of that, you get the chance at a do-over too. Did you mess up spectacularly? Well, you can spend your limited Chrono Tokens to wind back time to the start of your turn and see if you can do better. You can also earn back more of these tokens during combat by destroying certain types of enemies too and they get refreshed when you finish an Act.</p>
<p>You start off with one character and one mech (the Gunner) to choose from. Even just by itself, that would have been a great game due to the <em>heat</em> mechanics of the first mech. Heat is its card cost system, or mana that you might see in other deck-builders. Each card has a heat cost, and you have a maximum amount of heat you can build up per turn (it resets each turn). However, you can also go over your max heat to <em>overheat</em> and still use another card but you'll burn up that card and be unable to use it for the rest of the battle. A nice change compared to other similar deck-builders that allows a little wiggle room but with that big drawback. Remember those junk cards mentioned earlier? You can satisfyingly burn them up to get rid of them too.</p>
<p>However, once you manage to complete a full run the game will expand and open up to give you more characters with their own set of initial cards and uniqueness, and two other mechs that <strong>completely</strong> <em>change</em> the way you play the game which was a <em>huge</em> surprise. So to be clear: you pick a character with their own set of initial cards, and then pick a mech which comes with their own game mechanics for the battles. These layers add tons of replay value to the game to keep you going for hours.</p>
<p>The other two mechs you unlock replace the heat system from the Gunner with an energy system for the Stinger and a Mana system for the Keeper. The Keeper is the most different to the other two, as you're not inside a mech, instead you summon entities and haunt them moving them around the board. It's like three versions of the game in one.</p>
<p>However, one issue I have with it is how <em>long</em> it takes to unlock the two other mechs, which can be quite a while depending on how good you are at the game. However, leaning back into how accessible it is, there's options to skip the progression systems entirely to just play it your way with everything.</p>
<p>Like any good deck-builder, after each successful battle you'll be rewarded and here you can build up your deck to give you new tactical options during battles. There's some really fun cards here with lots of different combinations that become possible, which is why playing through it multiple times stays fun. Much in the same way that Slay the Spire had a firm grip on me, this very much did too.</p>
<p>As for the campaign, it's also nice and simple on the layout. You battle across the world, picking between nodes on the map that have different encounters in terms of enemy types and rewards. Initially you don't know exactly what will be inside until you've played through them to discover the enemies, and then picking between them gets a little easier.</p>

<p>Tested on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu Linux 25.04) with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> it was flawless. Valve gave it a Steam Deck Playable rating noting it has small text and sometimes doesn't show the right icons. I've played a bunch on Steam Deck too and while some text is a bit on the small side, it's mostly fine. I didn't notice any gamepad or icon issues. It's a great fit for the deck with gamepad controls and I really enjoyed playing it on the go too.</p>
<p>Overall it's an absolutely wonderful game that's a seriously easy recommendation. The style of it is just wonderful. Even though it's turn-based with cards, it somehow almost feels like an arcade game, at least a little. With the crunchy sound design too it's all just fantastic. Really unique and inventive and absolutely crammed with content even though runs are short, I'm absolutely hooked on it. Go and grab it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Craft the ultimate deck from the 400+ unique cards and artifacts available.</li>
<li>Choose from 3 powerful mechs, each with completely distinct playstyles and mechanics.</li>
<li>Master 10 diverse pilots, each adding new cards, mechanics, and a personal backstory.</li>
<li>Use Chrono Tokens to rewind time, undo mistakes, or land that perfect combo.</li>
<li>Battle through the multi-part story campaign and uncover a secret finale.</li>
<li>Endless replayability with ascending difficulties, daily runs, and challenge modes.</li>
<li>Designed for clarity and intuition—no long tutorials, no wiki required, just pure tactical deckbuilding.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 gets NVIDIA DLSS 4 improvements and a Steam Deck / SteamOS fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 from Insomniac Games, Nixxes Software and PlayStation Publishing LLC has Patch 10 out now with some NVIDIA upgrades along with a fix for some Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck, if you initially tried loading it while offline, it would result in a persistent PlayStation Network account linking error and wouldn't let you play. Patch 10 has solved this, thankfully. You still need an internet connection to play it for the first time but at least now it won't prevent you playing in future.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The rest of the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Release Notes (1.520.0.0)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Integrated NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Transformer model for upscaling and Multi Frame Generation for supported GPUs.</li>
<li>Added option to toggle between Legacy and Transformer models for NVIDIA DLSS upscaling.</li>
<li>Added Max Generated Frames option to control the number of generated frames when using Multi Frame Generation on NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where in particular Steam Deck players who performed the initial boot while offline encountered a persistent PSN account link error message, preventing them from starting the game.</li>
<li>Stability improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dune: Awakening will have BattlEye enabled for Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ahead of the release of Dune: Awakening, my one major concern with it has been swept away by the sands. Thankfully, the BattlEye anti-cheat will be enabled for players on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck to play it.</p>
<p>I've been trying to get a clear response on this for a while, even before we knew what anti-cheat system it would use. Thankfully, one of my press contacts today was able to speak to the developer directly to confirm "I'm pleased to say that that is indeed the plan" and that "Funcom are working with Steam to make this happen so rest assured".</p>
<p><em>Check out more <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility on our dedicated page</a>.</em></p>
<p>Excellent news. Would be a shame for players on Linux systems to miss out on what could end up being the biggest MMO for some time.</p>
<p>In other news, Funcom will be showing off the mid-to-end game in a livestream on May 28th across <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSo4SPH3nA" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, starting around 4PM UTC.</p>
<p>The most recent video, Dune: Awakening — Schools of the Imperium | The Mentat, shows off "A secretive and insular organization, the Order of Mentats conditions their adherents to store and analyze vast amounts of data at superhuman speeds. In Dune: Awakening, you can learn to condition your mind in this fashion to analyze the battlefield and become a master tactician and assassin"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FU9FxpHu-Ko"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4c5c2b69643ea569c5a5b84f0c7d3f6b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FU9FxpHu-Ko" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More info:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are some of the Mentat’s early skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sentinel: Deploy a suspensor buoyed dart projector that uses motion detection to cover a field of fire. Trigger a second time to activate.</li>
<li>Poison Capsule: You have a hidden dart dispenser that fires off a specially prepared capsule filled with poisonous spores. On impact, a cloud of poison appears, building poison on all who remain within.</li>
<li>Shield Wall: You deploy a half-height Holtzman shield that provides cover during combat for you and your allies. It will also slow enemies who attempt to pass through it – giving you time to take them down.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first Mentat trainer is Samin Moro, who you will find at Riftwatch, a Harkonnen base. Show her you have what it takes to create and administer poisons and she may teach you the ways of the Mentat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do have a key request in, so hopefully I'll be able to take a look close to or after the release to see how it runs in the full game to give you a clear report.</p>

<p>Even more Warhammer news for you coming out of the Warhammer Skulls event. We have the first trailer for Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II. Plus, you can get a free copy of Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War to keep and the original Mechanicus has a big discount.</p>
<p>Over on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489630/Warhammer_40000_Gladius__Relics_of_War/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War</a> is free to keep if you claim it before 26th May, 5PM UTC.</p>
<p>As for Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II, the first trailer can be viewed below. As well as familiar faces, you will encounter the Leagues of Votann for the <em>first</em> time in a Warhammer video game.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After millennia of slumber, Vargard Nefershah mobilises her dynasty’s legions to annihilate the Adeptus Mechanicus interlopers who unknowingly settled upon her world. Across the galaxy, Magos Dominus Faustinius is summoned to bring his hard-won expertise to bear and ensure the Necrons do not succeed. The conflict soon becomes a crucible of unanticipated significance, drawing to it external actors stranger and more deadly still.</p>
<p>Two playable factions, two narrative campaigns, two highly unique play-styles and one important choice – who will you lead to victory in this arcane technological war of cold metal hatred?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first game had a Native Linux version but it appears the sequel will not. So you'll need to play it with Valve's Proton. I've reached out to ask, but I fully expect it to not have a Linux port this time, the last game from Bulwark Studios didn't either.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s all the games to claim for Steam Deck / Linux from Prime Gaming as of May 23rd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the fresh and up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for May 23rd, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</img></img></img></img></p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/heroic-launcher-for-epic-gog-amazon-games-on-linux-steamos-v2-17-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> to see their status.</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War are getting remasters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition have been announced, refreshing two popular games bringing many enhancements to both. Both were announced recently during the latest Warhammer Skulls event.</p>
<p>For Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition there's no release date set yet. It will bring all these improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition delivers image-based lighting and upgraded unit textures, enhancing the overall presentation. Improved world lighting, unit reflections, more detailed shadows, surface gloss, and emissive lighting make for a superior experience, while retaining the classic Dawn of War feel. </p>
<p>Additionally, all units in the game have received texture upscaling of at least four times their original resolution, making for more detailed units, and a more readable experience.</p>
<p>Now on a 64-bit platform to support the ongoing efforts of the modding community, the Definitive Edition also includes an integrated Mod Manager and is compatible with over 20 years of lovingly crafted Community Mods.</p>
<p>An improved gameplay camera shows the battlefield like never before, working seamlessly on modern systems, including 4K displays. Increased draw distances make for a more cinematic experience, and the HUD and screen layout have been optimized for modern widescreen viewing.</p>

      <title>Splitgate 2 gets a Beta on Steam, works on Steam Deck but not other Linux systems for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Splitgate 2 brings back the free to play FPS with portals from 1047 Games, with a Beta now available. However, it's another game that will not work on Desktop Linux, only the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The first game actually had a Native Linux version, with the sequel dropping that so you need to play it with Valve's Proton compatibility layer. Only if you're on a Steam Deck, that is. Buried in their support page <a href="https://support.splitgate.com/hc/en-us/articles/32048091883031-Open-Beta-FAQ#Accordion-is-splitgate-2-steam-deck-verified--3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you support Linux?</p>
<p>Linux support is still experimental internally and won’t be supported for the Open Beta, but we’re using the Steam Deck as a first step. Keep an eye out on our <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news page</a> and social media for any updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, that's not noted in their main website <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/faq" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a>, which only mentions Steam Deck.</p>
<p>If you try to launch it on Desktop Linux, like Ubuntu / Kubuntu you'll just end up seeing this error:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13089521921747989625gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's now listed on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FB6lTW04oWM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d024f99bf6df7ef7590648163d29429.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FB6lTW04oWM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I sent multiple emails to the developer well before release to speak about Linux / Steam Deck support, sadly they did not reply to any of the emails but at least we have our answer for now.</p>
<p>I'm hoping with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wider launch of SteamOS now available</a>, that we see less developers locking their games to the Steam Deck. Although, we may end up seeing them lock it to SteamOS directly instead.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a big upgrade with SteamOS 3.7 and you can now install it on other AMD handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just released SteamOS 3.7 to the stable channel, bringing a huge amount of improvements to the Steam Deck. This also brings official support for the Lenovo Legion Go S, as well as Valve now officially giving you the option to load SteamOS onto other AMD powered handhelds.</p>
<p>Valve have also launched a new SteamOS page, finally retiring the old SteamOS 2 from the original Steam Machine launch. A day many have been waiting for, bringing Linux gaming even more into focus, with Windows on handhelds often being a sore spot.</p>
<p>From the new SteamOS page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Does this mean I can install SteamOS on any device? </strong></p>
<p>We expect most SteamOS users to get SteamOS preinstalled on a Steam Deck or device that incorporates SteamOS. The only devices officially supported on SteamOS right now are Steam Deck and Legion Go S.<br>
<br/>
We are working on broadening support, and with the recent updates to Steam and SteamOS, compatibility with other AMD powered PC handhelds has been improved. If you are interested in trying out SteamOS on your device and providing feedback, you can use the SteamOS Recovery Image and follow the instructions <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8778637651747988322gol1.jpg"/></p>

      <title>Deck-builder meets auto-shooter in Hordes of Fate : A Hand of Fate Adventure - demo now live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the original creative team behind the Hand of Fate series, Hordes of Fate : A Hand of Fate Adventure is a mixture of deck-building and auto-shooting as yet another developer attempts to put their own spin on Vampire Survivor-like action.</p>
<p>I continue my quest to play every survivor-like bullet heaven game possible, and this could quite easily win me over with its nice world design along with the interesting deck-building mechanics to make it feel nice and fresh.</p>
<p>I especially like that the various encounters in the game are not all set in stone, it's all dynamic based on the cards you pick to set it all up. And, when you go to grab chests or do the encounters in the game, some of those are not a given and get you to pick from a set of cards that can result in success or failure. Some of them will give you multiple choice on the outcome too. So far, it seems like a really interesting blend that manages to feel familiar for anyone who has played a survivor-like yet different.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FqFMhr0E88o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5a98f27a3a8425b1da72551bca5617d4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FqFMhr0E88o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This new title brings the franchise’s signature "cards come to life" deck-building into a fast-paced roguelite auto-shooter, complete with a deep progression system. As you play through it you can unlock new equipment, encounters, blessings, and powerful enchantments by discovering and completing encounter cards dealt into each stage. Fight through hordes of fiendish monsters and survive long enough to confront the powerful bosses in each of the game's challenges.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Stack Your Deck</strong></p>
<p>Hand of Fate set the standard for deckbuilding roguelikes in 2016, and now we're allowing you to build your own autoshooter. Text encounters and quests drawn from your deck allow you to unlock Tokens and earn new cards to expand the possibilities and grow your power for each subsequent run.</p>
<p>Discover hidden encounter outcomes and earn powerful weapon enchantments that transform your equipment, branching their power in new directions and creating unique builds and playstyles, keeping each run fresh and unique based on the cards dealt and the choices you make.</p>
<p><strong>Dark Fantasy Bullet Heaven</strong></p>
<p>Defeat minions, upgrade your equipment, and delve ever deeper into the world of Hand of Fate. Collect and assemble a devastating array of weapons and enchantments, and unleash hell upon wave after wave of fearsome monsters in fast and frenetic combat.</p>
<p><strong>Heroes Call</strong></p>
<p>Unlock a collection of heroes from the Hand of Fate universe, each with their own auto-shooting weapon and perk cards that add to the deckbuilding possibilities of each run.</p>
<p>Each hero comes armed with a unique activatable weapon card that can turn the tide of battle when the course of combat and shapes their unique playstyle.</p>
<p><strong>Hand of Fate Reimagined</strong></p>
<p>Uncover new and reimagined encounters and equipment, visit new locations and play as familiar heroes from across the Hand of Fate universe, all from a top-down auto-shooter perspective.</p>
<p>Fight hordes of Hand of Fate enemies and monsters on a scale never like never before.</p>

      <title>Drop Duchy is an inventive mixture of Tetris with deck-building and combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving a really odd and unique blending of genres and game mechanics, Drop Duchy is a wonderful choice for you to pick up and play. <em>Note: key provided for me by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>Tested on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updated-to-fix-missing-saves-and-a-new-proton-10-beta-fixes-gamepad-breakage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a>, it's been a perfect experience.</p>
<p>On the surface it seems very much like Tetris but it's also a deck-builder, that sprinkles in some basic combat too. At the basic level though, it's all very much about dropping blocks in the right places to build up the board in the best way possible. It can get a little complicated with all the different types of blocks but thankfully the tutorial and early gameplay is pretty great at showing you the ropes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="75RalDte2sE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/40b5c8eb7a4dd66b6d560fcb975e7003.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/75RalDte2sE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The idea here is that you go through an overworld of different nodes, each being a different type of board encounter to fill up with blocks. Some may be combat encounters, other just let you place down blocks to build up your resources to do upgrades and acquire more cards for your deck that form the blocks and eventually it all leads to boss battles.</p>
<p>Unlike say Tetris and other block-dropping games, the idea here is <em>not</em> to fill as little as possible or to remove things from the board. It reverses it by making you fill up the board completely in the way that gives you the biggest advantages in terms of gathering resources and building up your army. As you complete a whole line, the resources across that lined are then added into your totals for the current board mission. Complete multiple lines at a time and get bonuses.</p>
<p>One fun little addition is the reserve block option. At any point you can choose to reverse a specific block, instead of dropping it on the board. You can then swap this reserved block with another, if you feel the next is going to be a better fit. At the end of the round, the piece reserved will be discarded, so it's especially useful for enemy blocks to remove one from the round.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16338921101747921933gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16338921101747921933gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1575555021747921935gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1575555021747921935gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It turns it even into a very miniature city-builder due to the mechanics of dropping specific types of building blocks down, that all work together on the board to build you up. Very clever stuff in how it all comes together with the mixture of mechanics.</p>
<p>The battle system is on the basic side, but it works well with the main block-dropping mechanics here. You want to arrange the board in such a way that you get as many troops as possible across different types, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each troop building type gains bonus amount depending on what blocks they're placed next to, or what blocks you build up around them.</p>
<p>However, you're dropping down the enemy blocks to build up the board too. Everything here is about correct placement. It's not particularly punishing either, although it is a challenge. If you fail an encounter, it's not instant game over, since you have an overworld total health bar that you can fill back up as you play more of it to gather resources and currency as needed.</p>
<p>Once you're done and combat begins it's very much a simple game of numbers. You drag around units from point to point, either adding to each-other from your own forces or subtracting from the total based on the number of enemies at the point. Where it gets complicated is how different unit types have strengths and weaknesses, so you need to pay attention to this. Not just that, but when moving your units into a point full of a different type (say Archers and Axemen) they will combine into one type based on which type you have more of, so the order of movement is important too.</p>
<p>Combat isn't always forced either (except the boss battles), since the overworld map lets you often pick boards that don't have combat and let you focus on resources. Double-edged sword though, because avoid the combat encounters will end up making the boss battles more difficult in the end. The boss battles mix things up with their own little mini-game inside the board making them even more of a challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13429523951747921327gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13429523951747921327gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The biggest issue I have with it is the lack of an undo button, I am a repeat miss-clicker, and often I'll end up with pieces where I don't want them. It feels a bit punishing not to have this feature considering how absolutely vital the positioning is, so you have to be incredibly careful or restart the whole board. In a way, you could think it's cheating, but to me I think it's an accessibility / difficulty issue that should have been a feature of the game to give you at the very least 1 single undo.</p>
<p>Overall though it's really interesting to play, with lovely visual design and engaging game mechanics that's worth picking up. I'm terrible at Tetris but somewhat okay at this.</p>

      <title>MSI Claw handheld looks like it may get better Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new draft patch series for the Linux kernel has been submitted, which should hopefully bring up expanded support for the MSI Claw handheld.</p>
<p>From developer Antheas Kapenekakis the<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250511204427.327558-1-lkml@antheas.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> draft patch series</a> brings the msi-wmi-platform driver into parity with the MSI Center M for Windows for all models of the MSI Claw. So this should include fan curves, power controls and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7870531211747920036gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As Kapenekakis explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This draft patch series brings into parity the msi-wmi-platform driver with the MSI Center M Windows application for the MSI Claw (all models). Unfortunately, MSI Center M and this interface do not have a discovery API, necessitating the introduction of a quirk system.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">While this patch series is fully functional and tested, there are still some issues that need to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Armin notes we need to disable fan curve support by default and quirk it as well, as it is not supported on all models. However, the way PWM enable ops work, this makes it a bit difficult, so I would like some suggestions on how to rework this.</li>
<li>It turns out that to fully disable the fan curve, we have to restore the default fan values. This is also what is done on the OEM software. For this, the last patch in the series is used, which is a bit dirty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sleep was tested with all values being preserved during S0iX (platform profile, fan curve, PL1/PL2), so we do not need suspend/resume hooks, at least for the Claw devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's a draft there's still plenty that could change before it's accepted, merged and in a later Linux kernel release. Nice to see more work for various handhelds though, since it's a constantly expanding market. We also have work ongoing from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/manjaro-linux-lead-gives-more-info-on-the-new-zotac-gaming-zone-handheld-with-amd/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Manjaro team for the new ZOTAC ZONE with AMD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steamos-3-7-7-beta-brings-a-battery-charge-limit-option-and-improved-lenovo-legion-go-s-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve with the Legion Go S with SteamOS</a>.</p>

      <title>Embracer to spin off Coffee Stain, rebrand as Fellowship Entertainment and release 76 games in the next year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embracer have released their latest interim report, along with a statement on their plans to spin off Coffee Stain Group and go through a rebrand to Fellowship Entertainment.</p>
<p>With Coffee Stain, which was going by a working name of Coffee Stain &amp; Friends, they're now going to be called Coffee Stain Group. Embracer will turn them into a standalone group that will include the likes of Coffee Stain, Ghost Ship and Tuxedo Labs as well as certain studios from Amplifier Game Invest. The games under their belt include Deep Rock Galactic, Goat Simulator, Satisfactory, Teardown, Valheim, and Welcome to Bloxburg.</p>
<p>This will happen by the end of 2025, which at the same time  Embracer Group AB is getting a rebrand into Fellowship Entertainment, with the previous working name being Middle Earth &amp; Friends.</p>
<p>As for game releases, there's going to be a lot. Embracer said they plan to put out 76 different games over the next year ("FY 2025/26") which includes titles like Metal Eden, Gothic 1 Remake, REANIMAL, Fellowship, Wreckreation, the next SpongeBob SquarePants game, NORSE: Oath of Blood, Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, Killing Floor 3 and Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra. They also have a "handful titles yet to be announced".</p>
<p>Hopefully things will be more stable now for all the developers and other staff employed across the various companies that Embracer controls, which really is a ridiculous amount.</p>

      <title>The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller is a top premium-feeling controller</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I've been testing out the latest <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2-wireless-controller/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller</a> for over a week solidly now, and I really think it's a properly great controller and a worthy successor. <em>Disclosure: the controller was sent to me for review.</em></p>
<p>Like a number of you dear readers (yeah you!), I have become something of a controller <em>collector</em>. I have various Xbox controllers, a PS4 controller, the Stadia controller, the classic Steam Controller and the list goes on. I also happen to have the first 8BitDo Ultimate Wireless Controller, which until the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller came along, was my absolute go-to for all gaming that didn't force me to pick up my mouse.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6060672061747910292gol1.jpg"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20810603001747910291gol1.jpg"/></img></p>
<p>As always, I'm not someone to bury the lede or extend articles with completely unnecessary fluff. I'm not paid by the word here (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/support-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I'm paid by you!</a>). So let's get the message clear — this is an excellent controller, and if you're in need of a good wireless controller that isn't crazy expensive, then this is an ideal choice.</p>
<p>Thanks to Steam and Steam Input, and all the work Valve do to ensure devices work great on Linux, this controller is plug and play in both 2.4G mode and Bluetooth, with no issues in any of the games I've been blasting through over the last week. Steam detects it and away you go. This was tested on Kubuntu 25.04 and SteamOS (Steam Deck).</p>
<p>Everything about it just feels so damn good. It might not make me a better gamer, as I hide away on Easy difficult, but it sure makes me feel better about it.</p>
<p>The TMR Joysticks feel extremely responsive and smooth, and I especially like the feel of the triggers with the switch on the back to adjust them between linear Hall Effect triggers and non-linear tactile triggers. The triggers are smoother than the original and a bit longer too. Not a big fan of the new louder click on the shoulder buttons compared to the original though, I actually prefer the muted bump on the original, the shoulder buttons on this are <em>loud</em>. The refined D-pad feels a lot better too, it's still smooth for you to roll your fingers over, but there's a much clearer and more satisfying click on each button now. As for the ABXY buttons, they feel exactly the same as the original, which is fine because they already felt perfect.</p>
<p>What is a TMR Joystick anyway? Well, in the most simple terms: traditional controllers can wear out pretty quickly due to the direct physical contacts. Hall Effect is a big upgrade using magnets and electrical current, which should prevent wear-down and stick-drift. You can think of TMR as another upgrade over that, supposedly making them even more accurate and use less power too. And in this case, they feel amazing.</p>
<p>How does it compare to the original? Well, there's the problem. The original was already a damn good controller. This is just that but — even better. Unless you're a truly seasoned gamer, you might not tell a huge difference when it comes to the sticks and the triggers, but overall it is a nice big improvement for how it feels and how long it should actually last you (which is super important), it shouldn't wear out as quickly as other controllers. To be clear, my original was a personal purchase and while I still love it this is clearly superior in basically every way.</p>
<p>As for battery life, that hasn't been an issue at all. It hasn't run out a single time during my long lengths of gameplay. With the charging dock that comes with it, simply slotting it easily on top ensures it's always charged and ready to go. It's still probably the nicest controller dock I've ever used. No fiddling, you just drop it on top and away it goes charging.</p>

<p>There are, however, some <em>problems</em> with it that are unique to using it on Linux (and so Steam Deck / SteamOS systems). Starting with firmware updates, which you cannot do on Linux systems. For a while 8BitDo did put some earlier controller firmware updates on the <a href="https://fwupd.org/ " rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a> but they seemingly gave up and stopped doing that. So you need Windows for that. <em>Very Annoying.</em></p>
<p>The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller comes with some extra buttons. There's one each side on the back where your fingers rest, and also an additional one each side next to the triggers / shoulder buttons. Sadly, you also won't be able to configure or use the extra buttons on it with Steam, at least not <em>yet</em>. It seems we should hopefully be getting that sometime soon though, as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/8bitdo-ultimate-2-is-getting-full-steam-input-support-for-more-buttons/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve appear to be working on it</a>. <em>Although, this might only be in Bluetooth mode.</em></p>
<p>Since their software is Windows-only, you also cannot configure the RGB LEDs or do any of the fine-tuning their software allows. Not that I've needed to do anything mind you but worth mentioning. There is a button on the device to change the LED colour though, but only a few select options built-in to cycle through and turn the LEDs off. The lighting is just fluff that brings down the battery though, you might as well turn it off. I'll admit though, the mode where the rings change based on your input direction on the sticks and d-pad looks quite cool.</p>
<p>It's also quite fun to see that 8BitDo have been contributing to Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), the popular cross-platform open source development library. They've been <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/12661" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">submitting code</a> to hook up support for this very controller, <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/12693" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">and again</a> and <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/12964" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">other controllers too</a>. So eventually it will be real easy for developers to fully support their devices.</p>
<p>One last little gripe, their naming is terrible. We have the Ultimate, Ultimate 2, Ultimate 2C, Ultimate 3-mode, Ultimate 2 Bluetooth and so on for support across different systems and button layouts. <em>It all gets rather confusing. </em></p>
<p>Overall: it's a very sturdy and truly premium on the look and feel with a very reasonable price considering all the features you get from it. At this pricing (£49.99 / $59.99), it's probably the best you can get. Great stuff from 8BitDo.</p>

      <title>Try out the Steam Playtest for Gobutiko and become the greatest dice-rolling goblin merchant</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the upcoming game Gobutiko you are a goblin merchant, and of course being greedy you will haggle with your customers by rolling dice to wear them down and push the prices (hopefully) in your favour. The developer recently launched the first Steam Playtest, which has a Native Linux version.</p>
<p>More about it: "Leave behind your broken home, and live out your dream of becoming a merchant! As luck would have it, there's a Merchant Guild in a nearby village looking for fresh talent. Haggle your way into riches and prove to everyone that even a Goblin can be a great merchant!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="55hbj8lXpmM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/32be6ae4f6e21bc033d46b3948894050.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/55hbj8lXpmM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Haggle with the customers - To get the best deals you'll need to use your dice to pressure your customers into losing their composure and making it easier to push the prices in your favor. But be careful, they just might return the favor! Losing composure will force your shop to close early (can't have you yelling at your customers).</li>
<li>Customize your dice pool - Successfully selling an item multiple times will grant you effects that can be used to improve your haggling dice! When attached to your dice, these can change your roll values and/or add bonuses when used under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Build your shop - Not enough space? Tear down some walls! With your handy Build Kit, you can change your shop walls and floors until you've got just the right layout! Update your look by purchasing new walls and floor tiles from your local Merchant Guild.</li>
<li>Decorate - Fashion is the real end-game right? Show off your amazing taste to all your customers or sell it all and live in the woods. We won't judge! (Villagers might though)</li>
<li>Recruit new merchants to the guild - Invest your hard earned coin with the guild to help attract other merchants! Each new merchant will use their expertise to improve the village and bring new merchandise for you to sell in your shop.</li>
<li>Hang out at your local tavern - Relax at your local tavern every once in a while. Buy some food, relax at the bar, and chat with the locals! You might just learn about upcoming market trends.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently in Early Access, the action-RPG adventure Katana Dragon from Tsunoa Games recently added Native Linux and Steam Deck support. It originally launched on March 28th, with the Linux version being added May 16th.</p>
<p>More about it: "Katana Dragon is an action, adventure and dungeon exploration RPG, where you play as the ninjas Shin and Nobi in their quest to end the curse that hangs on Sogen. Learn ninja skills, upgrade your Dragon Gems, equip the Cursed Seals and level up. Avoid traps, solve puzzles and fight powerful enemies. Your ninja way begins!"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eSy6XcCLLt4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/07f47a01bce441d735eba3719781cfed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eSy6XcCLLt4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>EXPLORE A VAST WORLD - The beautiful lands of Sogen are waiting to be discovered. The whole map, their secrets, the challenges and even the dungeons have been hand designed.</li>
<li>MASTER NINJA SKILLS - Learn new ninja skills that will help you solve puzzles, defeat enemies and even reach new areas and discover their secrets.</li>
<li>FIGHT AGAINST ENEMIES - Fight against Gokais, powerful creatures capable of breathing fire, biting or even flying. Will you be able to register them all in your Gokairium?</li>
<li>DIVE INTO DUNGEONS - Explore dungeons, wells and caves to find treasures and test your training. Walk through rooms, avoid their traps, and fight against bosses in epic battles.</li>
<li>CUSTOMIZE YOUR LOOK - Change your appearance with different outfits: kimonos, armors, hats, masks, dresses and much more.</li>
<li>EQUIP &amp; UPGRADE YOUR DRAGON GEMS - Boost your stats using the power contained in Dragon Gems. Get them in different forms, sets, and rarities to suit your combat style.</li>
<li>BEWARE WITH CURSED SEALS - Cursed Seals are powerful but dangerous items which you can benefit from their power as you deal with their curse. No pain, no gain!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been almost completely overlooked, with only 7 Steam user reviews, but those early reviews sound very positive on how they feel about the game.</p>

      <title>Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS now listed for purchase in the UK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As the release of the Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS is approaching, multiple retailers now have it listed in the UK ready for delivery. Valve are <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steamos-3-7-7-beta-brings-a-battery-charge-limit-option-and-improved-lenovo-legion-go-s-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">still working on SteamOS support for it though</a>, which is perhaps just a little worrying as seems like it's coming out of the gate pretty hot.</p>
<p>Today I spotted it now live for sale in the UK across these stores below.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Lenovo direct:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/handheld/legion-go-series/legion-go-s/83l3003auk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ryzen Z2 Go (1TB)</a> - £600</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/handheld/legion-go-series/legion-go-s-powered-by-steamos/83n6001nuk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ryzen Z1 Extreme (1TB)</a> - £699</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Lenovo list both models with 32GB RAM. Lenovo also haven't correctly updated the page for the Z2 Go SteamOS version yet. It says it has SteamOS but the rest of the store page is just like the Windows version, whereas the Z1 Extreme properly lists SteamOS in the full info outside the specifications. Seems like they're still sorting the store pages.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Very:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.very.co.uk/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-handheld-pc-gaming-console-8in-wuxga-amd-ryzen-z2-go-16gb-ram-1tb-ssd/1601158643.prd" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ryzen Z2 Go (1TB)</a> - £549</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Very list it with 16GB RAM.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Currys:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://business.currys.co.uk/catalogue/tv-entertainment/gaming/gaming-consoles/lenovo-legion-go-s-handheld-gaming-console-amd-ryzen-z2-go-512-gb-ssd-grey/N548198W?from=category&amp;heat=title" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ryzen Z2 Go (5125GB)</a> - £498.99</li>
<li><a href="https://business.currys.co.uk/catalogue/tv-entertainment/gaming/gaming-consoles/lenovo-legion-go-s-handheld-gaming-console-amd-ryzen-z2-go-1-tb-ssd-grey/N530516W?from=category&amp;heat=title" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ryzen Z2 Go (1TB)</a> - £549</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Currys list both models with 16GB RAM. Curiously, they only list them on their Business store, not the normal store.</em></p>
<p>While it's good to see more devices with Linux beginning to ship, I really think the mixture of different specifications makes it more confusing for consumers.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.7.7 Beta brings a Battery Charge Limit option and improved Lenovo Legion Go S support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released SteamOS 3.7.7 Beta "Sunny &amp; Gizmo" with the noted changes including the new Battery Charge Limit option along with more work for the Lenovo Legion Go S.</p>
<p>A bit confusing this one, since Valve say in this SteamOS Beta how it includes the Battery Charge Limit option, which was actually rolled out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-battery-charge-limit-control-in-the-latest-beta/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earlier in May via a Steam Deck Beta Client update</a>. Presumably then, this is work directly in SteamOS to support it for more devices.</p>
<p>Valve are also working right up against the clock here for the Legion Go S, since the SteamOS version is due to launch really soon. From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/820329049655084698" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Battery Charge Limit control to Settings -&gt; Power.
	<ul>
<li>This option allows you to set a maximum charge limit for your Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Limiting the charge limit to 80% can be beneficial for long term battery health. This can be useful if your Steam Deck is constantly being charged (e.g. docked), or very rarely has its battery depleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the performance overlay could spuriously appear and could not be disabled.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where exiting a game from the overlay could result in the UI getting stuck until a button is pressed.</li>
<li>Desktop mode will no longer erroneously nag the user to install power profiles daemon.</li>
<li>Added support for updating controller and system firmware on the Legion Go S.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This update is available via the Beta and Preview channels in Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s some Steam Deck Verified games coming in 2025 to get excited about</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we enter the midpoint of 2025, you might be curious to know what upcoming games are Steam Deck Verified. I've looked under every rock on Steam and found a bunch you may want to add to your wishlist.</p>
<p>Being Steam Deck Verified means they should also run great on Desktop Linux and other SteamOS systems too. Although, do take the Verified with a pinch of salt on performance.</p>
<p>To make things easy for you the list is sorted so those coming sooner are at the top. Not the easiest list to do, since Valve don't actually test all that many games before they are released. There will no doubt be many more, but most get checked <em>after</em> release.</p>

<p>The game itself hasn't even been announced yet, so we have no real details here but it has leaked multiple times and was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-rated-steam-deck-verified-but-still-no-official-announcement-that-it-exists/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified back in April</a>. So it's coming, it's Verified but we really don't know when. Technically, it doesn't even exist yet but clearly it's on the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18499660861747852482gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Note: their Steam Deck Verified rating was correct at time of publishing, but it's entirely possible some ratings may change before they are released.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Bonus few — out today, or tomorrow.</em></p>
<p>We also had <strong><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-is-out-today-and-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a></strong> that just released today, which is Steam Deck Verified too. Great to see, especially since it has <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Monster Train 2</a></strong> also deserves a shout-out, as it also just released today and it's also Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>As another additional one <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a></strong> releases tomorrow, May 22nd, and again it's Verified! Same again with <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deliver At All Costs</a></strong> that arrives tomorrow.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>FBC: Firebreak</strong></p>
<p>While it <em>isn't</em> Verified yet, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/fbc-firebreak-from-remedy-releases-june-17-aiming-to-be-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Remedy Entertainment said they plan</a> to have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FBC: Firebreak</a> be Steam Deck Verified. It arrives on June 17th, so we'll be keeping an eye out on that one.</p>

      <title>FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time is out today and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LEVEL5 Inc. are releasing FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time today and the good news is that it's Steam Deck Verified. So it will work great on Desktop Linux and other SteamOS systems. The game does have Easy Anti-Cheat, which they've clearly enabled and so it's listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? A curious mixture of elements from the likes of Animal Crossing and Zelda, an action-adventure RPG wrapped up in a very cosy style with solo and online co-op play (supports Steam Remote Play Together) with an open-world setting. Their "Life" system sounds interesting, with 14 different jobs available in the game that you can switch between any time, with each having their own progression.</p>
<p>You can get an overview of the features in their previous video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="alqHzDtQvhE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3bc6c1d433863c8763ede8bf3fc28d9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/alqHzDtQvhE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For people who have played it during Advanced Access, a nice change to the multiplayer is being made with today's update to it so that "progress can be made on accepted quests even during multiplayer sessions" which was a pretty big oversight.</p>
<p>Looks like an incredibly sweet RPG, with the pre-release Steam user reviews already giving it a "Very Positive" rating.</p>

      <title>The latest HELLDIVERS 2 update is going to suck away lots of hours and it&#39;s discounted</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arrowhead Game Studios have just launched a major update to the popular co-op shooter HELLDIVERS 2, and with that there's many new enemies to face along with more customization options.</p>
<p>The game is still running rather nicely on Linux too, with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> being enabled for Linux since the original release. Not just that, but it's also <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/helldivers-2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">31% off on Fanatical</a> right now during their big sale which might actually be the lowest price for it so far.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Illuminate faction enemies.</li>
<li>New Weapon Customizations and Progression.</li>
<li>Crash fixes.</li>
<li>Weapon fixes.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous fixes.</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MmXtgHs2ODg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b16c4a3dd9c571dff53d0dbc77199bc8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MmXtgHs2ODg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>I've put a ridiculous amount of hours into HELLDIVERS 2 at this point and I'm going to play a lot more thanks to this update. I still think they have one of the best implementations of a "battle pass" compared to most other games, with no time-limited silliness and they stick around so you can claim stuff from them whenever you wish.</p>
<p>Have you been playing it on Linux recently? How's your experience been?</p>

      <title>NVIDIA release fresh details on their current Wayland support and future plans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have put up a new official forum post going over the level of Wayland support available in their current Linux drivers, along with what future plans they have. This replaces the post they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/nvidia-detail-upcoming-linux-driver-features-for-wayland-and-explain-current-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">detailed last year</a>, with new information based on their current 575 driver series.</p>
<p>It's mainly going over the differences in support for features between Wayland and X11.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The important bits from the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following features will not be supported on Wayland or Xwayland:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stereo rendering using GLX/EGL/Vulkan</li>
<li>Implicit SLI Mosaic
	<ul>
<li>This feature refers to when an application presents to a virtual display which is tiled across multiple physical displays.</li>
<li>Please see below for how “Explicit SLI” will be supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>nvidia-settings will not offer same level of configuration.
	<ul>
<li>There is no cross-compositor method for configuration that would allow nvidia-settings to manage displays on Wayland as it does on X11. nvidia-settings will still provide details about the system and power usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following features will instead be available through <strong>Vulkan Direct to Display</strong> (VK_KHR_Display):</p>
<ul>
<li>Stereo rendering
	<ul>
<li>VK_KHR_multiview provides optimization for drawing multiple viewports.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vulkan Explicit SLI
	<ul>
<li>Will be supported through VK_KHR_device_group</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Swap Groups
	<ul>
<li>Supported by VK_NV_present_barrier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Frame Lock and Genlock</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for future plans, there's no time-frame for any of it and some of it depends on future upgrades to Wayland and its protocols to support it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's what NVIDIA want to do at some point:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>nvidia-drm modeset=1 parameter set by default</li>
<li>Display multiplexers (muxes) are typically used in laptops with both integrated and discrete GPUs to provide a direct connection between the discrete GPU and the built-in display (internal mux) or an external display (external mux). On X11, the display mux can be automatically switched when a full-screen application is running on the discrete GPU, enabling enhanced display features and improved performance, but no Wayland compositors currently support this functionality.</li>
<li>Advanced display pipeline features including warp and blend, pixel shift, and the COLOR_ENCODING/COLOR_RANGE plane properties.
	<ul>
<li>These features may be exposed through DRM properties to allow compositors to use them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>nvidia-drm Presentation Timing information.</li>
<li>VDPAU support on Wayland.</li>
<li>vGPU support on Wayland.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>The Wandering Village 1.0 due in July with a price rise coming real soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stray Fawn Studio just announced that The Wandering Village, a city-builder on the back of a giant walking creature, will fully release on July 17th.</p>
<p>It's currently 30% off until May 27th, and after that the price is planned to increase to $29.99 so you might want to lock it in now to save quite a bit on it. Great time too, with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/city-building-on-the-back-of-a-huge-creature-the-wandering-village-gets-a-big-story-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently released story update</a> that expanded the game quite a lot.</p>
<p>They said that feature-wise, the current build is what will be in the 1.0 release. Right now they're focused on bug-fixing and quality to ensure a good release. However, the 1.0 release is not the end, as they plan to add plenty more content post-release. The "Onbu Update" was teased for after launch which will "further deepen how you can interact with Onbu" (the big creature you're building on top of).</p>
<p>A brand new trailer to show it off was also released:</p>

      <title>Manjaro Linux lead gives more info on the new ZOTAC GAMING ZONE handheld with AMD</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Project Lead of Manjaro Linux, Philip Müller, has given a status update with more info on their partnership with ZOTAC on the new prototype ZOTAC GAMING ZONE handheld.</p>
<p>Earlier this month <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/zotac-gaming-zone-handheld-getting-a-ryzen-ai-9-hx-370-prototype-with-a-manjaro-linux-based-os/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZOTAC gave a very brief announcement</a> of the new prototype ZONE that will come with an AMD CPU, which they've now been showing off during COMPUTEX.</p>
<p>From what we've learned it will have an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor with Radeon 890M graphics. Either 24GB or 32GB RAM with a 1TB SSD (M2 2280 NVMe). This includes a 7" AMOLED 1080p multi-touch display with HDR, Hall Effect joysticks and triggers, a 48.5Wh battery, a built-in kick-stand and shipping with Manjaro Linux instead of Windows.</p>
<p>What I missed, is that Müller from Manjaro made an official <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/development-q-a-zotac-gaming-zone/177928" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum post</a> going over the partnership, like how they met with ZOTAC at Computex 2024 and Gamescom Cologne 2024 to discuss it. Things got going in January 2025 with more discussions and the Manjaro team have been working since March 2025 to get the needed Linux kernel drivers in place. They're currently working on porting the ZOTAC One Launcher to Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9942580281747823881gol1.jpg"><br>
<em>Image Credit: <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/handheld-gaming/i-tried-the-updated-zotac-zone-handheld-and-one-big-change-makes-it-a-true-steam-deck-rival" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Tom's Guide</a></em></br></img></p>
<p>At the current stage they have most of the hardware working on Linux but they're still working on adding "missing functions to Zotac One Overlay" and porting the ZOTAC One Launcher to Linux.</p>
<p>Sounds like Manjaro are going the SteamOS route with their Linux version designed for handhelds, with a focus on Flatpaks for additional software along with KDE Plasma for the desktop mode along with it being an immutable OS.</p>
<p>As for when to expect it, they're currently aiming for a global Q3 2025 launch. Müller said they're working closely with AMD and ZOTAC, with plans to speak to Valve "in a later state of the project", presumably to ensure correct licensing to have Steam installed and configured out of the box.</p>
<p>ZOTAC themselves are still yet to put up any proper details of it on their website. ZOTAC also haven't replied to my press request about it.</p>

      <title>AMD announce the Radeon RX 9060 XT and a big FSR 4 &#39;Redstone&#39; upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun news coming out of Computex 2025 with AMD revealing two models of the Radeon RX 9060 XT, along with a big upgrade for FSR 4 named 'Redstone'.</p>
<p>AMD didn't give exactly much on the Radeon RX 9060 XT, with the press details on it being rather light. The basics specs and pricing for the cards are below:</p>

<p>For availability their original press announcement simply said it will be "later this year". However, during their actual livestream of Computex and their press materials sent over they said they will begin to be available on June 5th. This will include cards from the likes of Acer, ASRock, ASUS, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, Vastarmor, XFX and Yeston.</p>
<p>Sounds like a reasonable card, with AMD claiming it will be at around 6% faster than the NVIDIA RTX 5060 Ti across 40 games tested "without upscaling or frame generation".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/514392831747844839gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/514392831747844839gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17497838621747844838gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17497838621747844838gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Designed to unlock ultra-smooth gaming at 1440p, the Radeon RX 9060 XT is built for players who expect more. Equipped with up to 16GB of GDDR6 memory and 32 AMD RDNA 4 compute units, the GPU doubles ray tracing throughput compared to the previous generation, providing gamers with more realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections that bring virtual worlds to life.</p>
<p>Second-generation AI accelerators power features like FidelityFX™ Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4), which uses machine learning to boost frame rates and image fidelity under even the most demanding rendering conditions. HYPR-RX delivers a full suite of optimizations, including Radeon Super Resolution and Fluid Motion Frames for lightning-fast response times and immersive, tear-free visuals. With support for FP8 data types and structured sparsity, the RX 9060 XT is ready for the next generation of AI-assisted gameplay, creative tools, and generative experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for AMD FSR 4's Redstone update, it sounds rather promising, as AMD continue trying to catch up to NVIDIA. It's still for RDNA4 only, since it was designed for their latest generation of cards. It will include "Neural Radiance Caching", "Machine Learning Ray Generation" and "Machine Learning Frame Generation".</p>
<p>FSR 4 should be available in over 60 game titles by June 5th according to AMD.</p>

      <title>Latest Steam update fixes Steam Deck controller issues, plus numerous bugfixes for Desktop Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the latest stable Steam Client update for all platforms bringing numerous important bug fixes to Steam Deck and Desktop Steam.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods cross-platform app v0.11.1 brings full Cyberpunk 2077 support for Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Nexus Mods team just launched the latest update to their in-development cross-platform open source Nexus Mods app. This is the one that will eventually replace Vortex, and now it has full Cyberpunk 2077 support.</p>
<p>Support for Cyberpunk 2077 in the previous release was a "soft launch", but now they feel it's good enough for everyone to get modding. So it sits alongside Stardew Valley as the two main supported games currently. The rest (Baldur's Gate 3 and Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord) are hidden behind an experimental option you can enable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5887447181747757044gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As a reminder for Cyberpunk 2077 it offers:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility with the Steam and GOG Galaxy releases on Windows and Linux.</li>
<li>Support for the most common types of mod: REDmod, archives, REDscript, and framework mods (e.g. Cyber Engine Tweaks).</li>
<li>Support for collections.</li>
<li>Health Check diagnostics for missing dependencies.</li>
<li>Health Check diagnostics to help set up a Linux environment to mod the game.</li>
<li>REDmod Load Order management and deployment.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more changes in this version including the new and improved load order tab for REDmod, and lots of smaller improvements to the UI flow to make modding easier than ever.</p>
<p>I'm especially happy about their focus on making Linux / SteamOS / Steam Deck modding as easy as possible, something we've been lacking for a long time. Like including proper instructions for Linux systems:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14466420961747757081gol1.png"/></p>
<p>All the rest of the changelog below:</p>

<h4>More Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Updated the Health Check messages for Cyberpunk 2077 to match the structure of other diagnostic messages.</li>
<li>When hovering the cursor to resize panels, a solid line will now appear to better indicate which panel will be adjusted.</li>
<li>The app now has its own minimise, maximise and close buttons, removing the operating system "chrome" and saving more vertical space.</li>
<li>The tab bar is now hidden until there are at least two tabs in a panel.</li>
<li>Tabs can now be closed with a middle click.</li>
<li>Added mod thumbnails to the load order page.</li>
<li>Increased resilience to network errors during downloads.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Technical Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>On Linux, the app will only register itself as the default Nexus Mods download handler when not installed with a package manager.</li>
<li>Replaced the Stardew Valley preview UI elements with game-agnostic versions.</li>
<li>Added the core backend frameworks required for the "Undo" feature.</li>
<li>Added the core backend frameworks to allow the app to create and share collections.</li>
<li>Improved the stability of downloads by requesting the entire file rather than using range requests.</li>
<li>Use the recent rating for collections instead of "All time".</li>
<li>The app will now send headers with Nexus Mods requests to allow us to better track mod manager usage.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Games can be unmanaged via the command line (thanks to Michael-Kowata on GitHub).</li>

      <title>Celebrating 10 years, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and older titles are heavily discounted</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you've still not had the chance to grab The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, now is your best bet with the 10th anniversary celebration giving huge discounts. CD PROJEKT RED have put the game, and the older titles in the series, on some of the best discounts they've ever had.</p>
<p>There's also a fancy new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TWOkT7l0yWQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2aa280c2a698ccb6a741431a6b06f555.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TWOkT7l0yWQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Celebrations also included an anniversary edition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlRkbwmlNsg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">REDstreams</a>, which took place May 19th and featured Geralt’s voice actor Doug Cockle, alongside English Adaptation Director Borys Pugacz-Muraszkiewicz. The voice actor took a walk down memory lane, reminiscing on his time as the voice of Geralt, his experience with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and how the role has impacted him over the years.</p>
<p>The Witcher in Concert is also gearing up to introduce attendees to a one-of-a-kind live event featuring an ensemble orchestra and a blend of cutting-edge visuals and gameplay. Two anniversary celebrations are planned: Boston on May 31 and Poznań on June 15. All of this will lead up to the official tour kickoff at gamescom in Cologne on August 20, with tickets for the European leg of the tour already available for purchase on the official Witcher in Concert <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/pl/en/concert" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="">website</a>. New dates and locations will be revealed in the future, with newsletter subscribers receiving access to all official pre-sales.</p>
<p>The base game is 90% off across GOG and Steam (best-ever discount, but has been that low before). And it's 80% off for the complete edition. So you can get the full thing for about £7. An <em>absolute steal</em> for such a huge and engrossing game.</p>
<p>Works great on Desktop Linux with Proton and is rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve.</p>
<p>A deal not to miss.</p>

      <title>RoadCraft runs surprisingly well on Steam Deck and great on Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RoadCraft is about to release from Saber Interactive / Focus Entertainment, their next-gen heavy-machinery simulation and sandbox game from the team behind the popular SnowRunner and MudRunner. The good news - it runs on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. <em>Note: key provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>What is it? A calm slow-paced simulation game where you run a disaster recovery company restoring various sites devastated by natural disasters. Your tasks will involve clearing debris, rebuilding entire roads and bridges and getting your vehicles unstuck as you'll be dealing with some pretty terrible conditions often. There's some big differences to the previous games like Snowrunner with no fuel to worry about or damage, so it's not quite as hardcore and a bit more welcoming (and certainly easier to get into).</p>
<p>So in RoadCraft the main emphasis is about the journey, and finding the best route forwards using the best tools for the job. Often, multiple vehicles will be needed to complete a task and so it all builds up as you progress through. Getting stuck in the mud is still a huge pain in the ass though. But entertaining when you try all sorts of tricks to get unstuck.</p>
<p><em>Click the article images below to enlarge them.</em></p>
<h4>Steam Deck</h4>
<p>My testing was done on the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steamos-3-7-5-for-steam-deck-now-in-beta-with-big-upgrades-and-initial-support-for-more-hardware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS Beta 3.7.5</a>, since it's approaching release as the next stable version. Considering how big the changes are, I felt it didn't make sense to stick with the much older stable SteamOS release (but I checked, and it did run on SteamOS 3.6.24). The game is confirmed to work with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>, but then I switched to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updated-to-fix-missing-saves-and-a-new-proton-10-beta-fixes-gamepad-breakage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a> since again, that should release soon as the new stable Proton version.</p>
<p>Don't go expecting incredible performance here though, this is a time to firmly keep expectations in check. Like a lot of bigger recent releases this is a game you'll be looking at 30FPS on the Steam Deck, with everything set to Low visuals. However, compared to some other big recent releases, I'm amazed it works to this level. Especially nice, since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/sadly-the-roadcraft-demo-is-currently-broken-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo didn't work at all</a> originally. <em>No extras needed here, it was click and play.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5908707761747741084gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5908707761747741084gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15042860201747741083gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15042860201747741083gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>I've seen numerous times where performance <em>can</em> go above 30FPS, if you set the in-game FPS limit to 60FPS, but it's far more stable and enjoyable if you just keep it to the set 30FPS in-game limit. I found there was a fair bit more stuttering at times unless I kept it to 30FPS. No matter what, there's still some traversal stutter when driving around as you pop through new areas, but it mostly smoothens out quite quickly, the drops are very momentary.</p>
<p>Turning off the FPS counter and just letting myself get absorbed by it was a wonderful experience — except the times where I forgot to put the handbrake on, put the Steam Deck down to have a drink or a bite to eat, and came back to find my vehicle had rolled into the mud and gotten stuck. Woops.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2781641881747744517gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2781641881747744517gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20129716891747744518gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20129716891747744518gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm impressed on how clear the game UI is here on Steam Deck, it really feels like a great fit for it. Everything is nice and readable out of the box with no tweaks needed. There's no UI or text sizing options though, not that I've needed them, but that would have been a nice addition to have for those that do need things just a bit bigger.</p>
<p>Even with lots of different controls, with each vehicle being quite different, it was clearly made with gamepad controls in mind too. They're all clearly shown on-screen and after a while it's pretty easy to get the hang of all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3159972011747746742gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3159972011747746742gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13455019091747749141gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13455019091747749141gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>For the exact settings I've been testing on Steam Deck with:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18533464031747738408gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18533464031747738408gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10141045911747738409gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10141045911747738409gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>These are all the <em>defaults</em> the game gave on Steam Deck, which <em>seem</em> to be the best way to play it. The Deck really can't handle bumping much of these up at all. Which is not surprising really. Even with details set to Low and FSR3 set to Performance, the visuals are still pretty good here, far better than a number of other bigger titles to the point that I've not had an issue with how it looks on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>What has surprised me is the battery life. On the Steam Deck OLED, you get a pretty reasonable 2.5+ hours. On the Steam Deck LCD it's just under 2 hours. So you'll still want to keep a charger or battery pack close by but very reasonable for this type of bigger game.</p>
<p>I would expect Valve to rate this as Steam Deck Playable as you need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard to enter in any names. Apart from that though, everything else pretty much worked as expected with a mostly stable 30FPS experience. <em><strong>Update</strong>: just as I clicked publish, Valve set it as Steam Deck Playable.</em></p>
<h4>Desktop Linux</h4>
<p>Considering how it runs on Steam Deck, there's not a whole lot extra to say about Desktop Linux here. Testing again with the <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updated-to-fix-missing-saves-and-a-new-proton-10-beta-fixes-gamepad-breakage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a>, the game runs well although I did notice some minor graphical artifacts in places which may be due to the Mesa version used. On my Kubuntu 25.04 setup with AMD Ryzen 5800X, with the Radeon RX 6800 XT on Mesa 25.0.3 the performance has been great.</p>
<p><u>NVIDIA</u>: if you have an NVIDIA GPU, there's currently a driver bug with the game so it won't run out of the box. You can use <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/pyroveil/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pyroveil</a> to work around it and hopefully get it launching. As noted by the VKD3D-Proton developer on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8694#issuecomment-2893555768" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Back to AMD…it looks fantastic! Ultra settings with AMD FSR3 Native (just AA):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13703237731747753216gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13703237731747753216gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then AMD FSR3 Quality:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9642285601747753281gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9642285601747753281gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's barely a difference in visual quality, but a clear performance difference. And then with Frame Generation turned on, it's about double the performance:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19779592781747753366gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19779592781747753366gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>In motion, I cannot tell a difference with AMD FSR3 Frame Generation turned on, so the performance benefit there is great while being able to keep the graphics cranked up to Ultra where it looks awesome as you sort the roads out.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p><em>The only part not tested was online co-op play due to the preview period but I don't foresee any issues there since there's no <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> nuisances here.</em></p>
<p>Part of what makes this one real interesting is that it's not all about you. While you're doing a lot of the work, you're then setting up routes for AI vehicles to travel through to deliver various goods. Spectating them as they go through your planned routes that you've sorted and cleared is so satisfying, although the AI drivers are complete <em>morons</em> and get stuck on the smallest obstacles. They will not try to avoid anything at all (including trying to drive through you), so you often spend a lot of time micro-managing your newly placed routes. Once you get a good route going for the first time after clearing everything and rebuilding though, it's lovely to see your work in action.</p>
<p>At its heart, RoadCraft is as much a puzzle game with you figuring out how to overcome every tiny little obstacle, as it is a challenging driving and mini-construction sim. If you liked Snowrunner or Mudrunner, you will most likely enjoy this although keeping in mind some parts of the sim have been simplified.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0YxFJTFi0Os"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b189e5184fda8816cfbd5dd6e035dc3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0YxFJTFi0Os" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Roadcraft is very much a game for people who have a lot of free time to get stuck in the mud, and you will, if you're an idiot like me. On both Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, it has been quite an enjoyable experience, although frustrating when you spend a bit too much time getting stuck. Very much like Snowrunner, you need to bring along a healthy dose of patience.</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition is out now, needs a workaround on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GSC Game World have released the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition now which includes S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chornobyl - Enhanced Edition, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky - Enhanced Edition and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Prypiat - Enhanced Edition.</p>
<p>If you own the originals, you should receive the new editions for free. The Enhanced Editions also include the originals.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AVWkOx4Cj6g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4900cb606d0aec6b927d8a7e6f37d983.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AVWkOx4Cj6g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Each game comes with an assortment of upgrades including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Atmospheric visual enhancements including God Rays, Dynamic Screen Space Reflections, and Advanced Global Illumination effects.</li>
<li>Redesigned water shaders, upgraded skyboxes, and wetness effects.</li>
<li>Improved visuals with upscaled textures featuring more detailed NPCs and environment.</li>
<li>Upgraded weapon Field of View and models.</li>
<li>Multiple bugfixes and quality of life tweaks.</li>
<li>Full gamepad support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This also makes the series a much better fit on the Steam Deck too. Plus there's also Steam Workshop support and Cloud Saves as well.</p>
<p>The only one I actually own is S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Prypiat, so that's what I picked for some testing today, along with the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updated-to-fix-missing-saves-and-a-new-proton-10-beta-fixes-gamepad-breakage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 10 Beta</a>. Early reports from players on Steam have pushed all three Enhanced Editions rapidly into "Mostly Negative". Many noting it's a "blurry mess", so I wanted to see what's going on.</p>
<p>On <strong>Desktop Linux</strong>, the game will not run out of the box, and ends up giving a black screen with this error:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20538914521747749867gol1.png"/></p>
<p>You can get around that by spoofing a Steam Deck, using this launch option:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>On <strong>Steam Deck</strong> however, the game does work out of the box.</p>
<p>Once getting into S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Prypiat - Enhanced Edition and fiddling with some settings here's some unfiltered shots of it on Max settings at 2560x1440. Running on Kubuntu 25.04, AMD Ryzen 5800X, Radeon RX 6800 XT on Mesa 25.0.3:</p>

<p>To me, the game doesn't look particularly blurry, certainly not to the level the Steam user reviews are suggesting. There's some slight blurry bits the further you are away but the picture is overall quite clear. And on Max settings, it seems to run well enough on Desktop Linux. Even with the enhancements though, I would have expected performance to be a fair bit higher than it is.</p>

      <title>Steel Swarm: APOCALYPSE is a tank-battling MOBA set for Early Access in June</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steel Swarm: APOCALYPSE is an upcoming tank-battling MOBA that I'm pretty excited about for the huge battles and map destruction. And now the developer has revealed it's set to release in Early Access on June 24th.</p>
<p>I previously covered this one <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/steel-swarm-apocalypse-is-a-tank-battling-destructive-moba-that-will-have-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in April</a>, when they announced full Steam Deck support. Seems they're going a step further now, since they're also noting Linux support in the release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199180/view/800062851651732420" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kx-u_InH0SY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/65d0ead0be6490c85135f6e9590895a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kx-u_InH0SY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I like that it sounds quite different to other MOBAs. Instead of just a basic 5 v 5 with some AI minions in parts, there's a whole lot going on. Their focus is on a large-scale battlefield with over 100 minions per team, which is "per avenue" (lanes to battle through) resulting in there being thousands of units in each game. They say that "no other MOBA will compare" to the scale of this one.</p>
<p>The map destruction also looks like it could be fun as you reshape it as you go. You're in a tank, so you have a lot of firepower.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Garden released at the start of April, with a fresh update that just released adding in controller support and Native Linux support. Looks like another very sweet casual game to relax with.</p>

      <title>Cosy vertical tile-stacking nature-building puzzle game Preserve is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Preserve from developer Bitmap Galaxy is a nature-building puzzle game where you build tiles in an interesting mix of horizontal and vertical gameplay that's just left Early Access. It's really sweet, great to unwind with.</p>
<p>Here you just keep on adding layers of nature until it all fits nicely together. The idea is that you're restoring and building up various diverse connected biomes and it really does look lovely while you're playing it. A soft casual puzzle game that won't make your brain sweat, accessible thanks to the clean and clear design and engaging enough to keep you going as you want to see what happens as you place all the tiles down to watch it come alive. Dorfromantik was one of their main inspirations for it, so if you've seen or played that, you know some of what to expect.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Full release features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full Compendium</strong> - Players dive into detailed card mechanics, scoring, and gameplay strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards</strong> - Gamers climb the ranks and compare preservation skills.</li>
<li><strong>Platform-Specific Achievements/Trophies</strong> - Players celebrate their victories.</li>
<li><strong>Engaging Weekly Challenges</strong> - Compete with friends and build nature.</li>
<li><strong>Card Trading in Harmony Mode</strong> - More control over the deck and strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Puzzle Collection</strong> - More brain-bending nature puzzles.</li>
<li><strong>Brand New Jurassic Biome</strong> - Preservers uncover a prehistoric world of wonder.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>During Early Access it managed to get a Very Positive rating from Steam players. It launches with Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable (some small text / on-screen keyboard has to be pulled up manually).</p>

      <title>Upcoming Steam update should fix lag spikes on Linux when the Steam Overlay is disabled</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For quite some time now Linux gamers have been reporting issues with lag spikes in various games on Steam when the Steam Overlay is disabled. It seems Valve may have finally found the cause and a fix is hopefully on the way.</p>
<p>There's been a bug report open on the Steam GitHub page since <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/11446" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">November 2024</a>, with hundreds of comments discussing the issue. One workaround has been to set this as a launch option for games:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">LD_PRELOAD="" %command%</code></p>
<p>However, that's only good if you know that workaround exists. Ideally, games should perform the same if you have the Steam Overlay enabled or disabled.</p>
<p>Writing on the GitHub, Valve contractor Timothee "TTimo" Besset <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/11446#issuecomment-2892172851" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wrote</a> on May 19th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey all - thanks for the reports. We believe we have a fix for this issue, it hasn't made it's way through our release pipeline yet but I'll update here when we do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully then we'll see this problem solved soon.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released driver version 570.153.02, a new bug-fix release for their current main stable driver version for Linux gamers. In case you missed it: back in late April, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/nvidia-disclose-new-security-flaw-in-their-linux-gpu-drivers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA revealed a new security flaw</a> in their drivers so you're going to want to make sure you're up to date.</p>
<p>This is a small bug-fix release only, here's the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications and compositors to stall when using NVIDIA as a PRIME Display Offload sink ("Reverse PRIME"), potentially resulting in a black screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that led to increasing memory usage in X11 OpenGL and Vulkan applications after suspend/resume cycles.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Ludaro is a deck-building roguelike spin on Ludo with a demo out now</title>

<p>I wrote about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ludaro-puts-a-roguelike-deck-building-twist-on-the-classic-board-game-ludo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ludaro back in mid April</a>, and now you can try this new chaotic spin on Ludo yourself, as they've just released a first demo for it. Love seeing more developers attempt to refresh classics like this!</p>
<p>Ludaro is a roguelike deck-building dice game with a unique twist on Ludo! Plan your moves, manipulate deterministic dice rolls, and unleash powerful Spirit Cards to beat the score. Upgrade tiles, collect quirky pets and stack wild combos as you battle in epic boss fights with game-changing modifiers.</p>
<p>Check out their recent trailer to get a glimpse of it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FSyyM3cMs5Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a45e3f59c061b81fd351a07ef343eb84.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FSyyM3cMs5Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo is out now which has a Native Linux version. The full game is due sometime later this year. Should run great on Steam Deck too which is what they've said they're optimising it for.</p>

      <title>GOG add support for authenticator apps for two-factor authentication (2FA)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for keeping your games secure, as <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> have announced they've added support for authenticator apps for two-factor authentication (2FA). Previously GOG only supported sending a code via email, but now you can pick whatever auth app you want.</p>
<p>If you have email codes on, you have to first disable it. Then GOG will give you a QR code to scan via your favourite auth app (or a code to manually enter). As noted on the <a href="https://www.gog.com/news/you_can_now_use_authenticator_apps_to_keep_your_gog_account_secure" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG news post</a>. Not much more to it than that!</p>
<p>This is great to see. I hope Valve eventually follow this for Steam, as currently Valve only offer Steam Guard which forces you to use their mobile app, which they don't exactly put a lot of time into. Would be great if Valve also allowed you to use your favourite auth app.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">While you're here, perhaps take a look at some of the current sales on GOG like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/20250515_witcher3_anniversary" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Witcher 3 Anniversary Sale</a></li>

<p>In case you missed it; GOG also recently announced they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/gog-begin-rolling-out-dynamic-bundle-pricing-to-complete-your-collections/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">finally added dynamic bundle pricing</a>.</p>

      <title>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is now open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft just announced that the Windows Subsystem for Linux is now officially open source. While it doesn't necessarily mean much for traditional desktop Linux, it's still a nice move.</p>
<p>For those who have never used it, or don't know what it is: it's a feature of modern Windows that allows you to run a Linux environment on your Windows machine, without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual booting.</p>
<p>Writing on the official Windows blog the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/05/19/the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-is-now-open-source/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> mentions that there's still a couple of bits that are not open source, but a big step forwards for it. It also goes over a brief bit of history of it like how they had to separate it from the Windows code-base to enable Microsoft to keep up with the growing community and feature requests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the years we’ve been incredibly lucky to have a strong community supporting WSL from day 1. We’ve been blessed with people sharing their knowledge, and spending countless hours to help track down bugs, find the best ways to implement new features and improve WSL.</p>
<p>WSL could never have been what it is today without its community. Even without access to WSL’s source code, people have been able to make major contributions that lead to what WSL is now.</p>
<p>This is why we’re incredibly excited to open-source WSL today. We’ve seen how much the community has contributed to WSL without access to the source code, and we can’t wait to see how WSL will evolve now that the community can make direct code contributions to the project.</p>
<cite>Pierre Boulay, Microsoft</cite></blockquote>
<p>We really have come a long way from the Microsoft of old.</p>

      <title>Search engines are getting worse, so OpenWebSearch funded by the European Union want to fix it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not gaming news but an important subject to cover anyway since it's something that affects me and GamingOnLinux directly, as well as all of you who regularly use a search engine. The <a href="https://openwebsearch.eu/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OpenWebSearch</a> might be one way to save us all.</p>
<p>It's certainly no secret that web searching is getting worse as all the AI enshittification continues. AI is more and more forced in your face, and the big few (Google, Microsoft) like to keep as much control as they possibly can. Just look at recent news, with Microsoft <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates?id=492574" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cutting off</a> access to Bing Search APIs on August 11 2025 as they continue to pivot to AI.</p>
<p>Especially important for sites like GamingOnLinux, and pretty much any news site that isn't one of the big few that keep buying up all the others, as we might only be one algorithm change from not being shown in search results at all.</p>
<p>OpenWebSearch is one possible new ally in this internet fight, a European Union-funded project to build up a massive modern search index that doesn't depend on the big US giants. The idea is <em>not</em> to build a search system themselves, but to provide an open search API, so that others would be able to hook into it and make use of it.</p>
<p>They've just <a href="https://openwebsearch.eu/june-event-announcement-the-open-web-index-goes-public/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced recently</a> that it's going public in June:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 2,5 years of intensive research and programming efforts, the entire Openwebsearch.eu project team is excited to grant access to its pilot of the first-ever federated pan-European Open Web Index (OWI).</p>
<p>From June onward, commercial and scientific development teams of any size as well as interested individuals are welcome to access and make use of almost a petabyte (and growing) of open web data under a general research license or – upon request – under a designated commercial license as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm very interested to see what becomes of this one. Hopefully something meaningful, but I remain skeptical on it doing much to make a dent in the sides of Google and Bing. Depends if they manage to get some search engines to make good use of it or not and if the licensing when it's out fully is actually reasonable.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-2 brings some essential fixes for Windows games on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/ge-proton-10-1-released-with-proton-10-and-fixes-for-marvel-rivals-oblivion-remastered-and-more-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big GE-Proton 10-1 version</a> that updated the community-maintained Windows compatibility layer to Proton 10, a smaller bug-fix release is out with some essential fixes. As is often the case with GE-Proton, the 10-1 release came with some issues so this hotfix <em>should</em> solve most of the reported problems.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about all the different Proton versions be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read my guide</a>. And my guide on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">how to install GE-Proton</a>. My usual advice is to stick with Valve's official Proton, unless there's something specific you need in GE-Proton.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The changes in <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton10-2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GE-Proton 10-2</a> are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixes missing comma in proton script causing prefix issues (this was also a valve upstream issue).</li>
<li>Fixes accidental import of the steam ffmpeg libraries instead of the ones we build and ship (this was an accidental copy/paste when porting changes from Proton 10) -- this should fix video playback in a lot of titles as they worked in proton 9.</li>
<li>Removes setting ENABLE_HDR_WSI -- this option is only specific for the vk_hdr_layer. (<a href="https://github.com/Zamundaaa/VK_hdr_layer" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Zamundaaa/VK_hdr_layer</a>) hack, which is -not- needed as of mesa 25.1 and can cause washed out colors. If you previously used this, it's advised to remove it, and update mesa to 25.1 if you want HDR.</li>
<li>added a few patches for allowing more launchers to work in wayland (epic, battlenet, star citizen).</li>
<li>added patch to allow 32 bit EOS overlay to work for Among Us.</li>
<li>added raw input patches for winewayland (un-accelerated mouse).</li>
<li>added touchpad scrolling support patch for winewayland.</li>
<li>xalia library updates imported from upstream.</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git.</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Utopia Must Fall is easily one of the best modern arcade shoot &#39;em ups</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Utopia Must Fall from developer Pixeljam has absolutely absorbed my attention recently. It's easily one of the best modern arcade shoot 'em ups I've ever played. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>It's like a glorious mixture of Missile Command for your base to defend, with Space Invaders for some of the style and enemy behaviours along with a seriously mysterious moody atmosphere, one that really sucks you right in. So it's a mixture of classic retro arcade gameplay with some tower defence. Add to that the rapid constant progression with you upgrading constantly, there's a lot to love about this.</p>
<p>Spread across a few differently styled cities, you're tasked with one single objective — defend against the apocalypse. You do so by swinging a great big rail-gun that auto-fires. Its position is static, so all you do is swing left to right to align it as it fires as you try to take down every single enemy that appears on screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5551674071747659617gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5551674071747659617gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9251409841747659616gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9251409841747659616gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The tricky bit is how your main weapon is a bit slow to align, although there are upgrades to speed up its rotation. The upgrade system is what's the shiny hook here. You choose your own path through it. After each day, you're able to pick certain contracts to power up something. This could be upgrading nuclear missiles with antimatter that end up sucking everything in, automated facilities to send out configurable drones to help you defend, increase gun fire rate (or twin guns) and so on.</p>
<p>You can re-roll some upgrades you get if you don't like them, which is done quite amusingly in-world, in the way of a Citizen Proposal. This might be something like constructing a decoy city, or invite the aliens for a chat. They don't do anything, other than let you re-roll upgrades but a fun touch.</p>
<p>On May 14th, they just launched a big update for the game including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Skill tree: fully overhauled upgrade system with interactive tree structure, graphical icons for every upgrade and 4 special 'opportunity' slots. Requirements, blockers, hierarchy and time constraints for regular upgrades are demystified.</li>
<li>Drones! Automated floating, modifiable allies that dodge hazards and chase enemies, equipped with onboard railgun turrets and adjustable behavioural parameters.</li>
<li>Drone-related upgrades: Deploy Drone Factory, Twin Drone Factory, Atomic Drones, Double-Barrelled Drones, Robotics Specialist</li>
<li>Watchtower mod: Q Disruptor - targets are temporarily timewarped to 0.25x regular speed</li>
<li>Opportunity Upgrades: Cheap Nukes, Work Retreat, Red Flag Day, Context Switch</li>
<li>New cities to defend: Cairo Horizon and HyperParis</li>
<li>Many other additions, improvements, tweaks, balances, fixes, etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I've played a lot of retro games over the years, and a lot recently too but Utopia Must Fall stands apart from the crowd because it's just so satisfying and nicely designed.</p>
<p>It works well on Desktop Linux with Proton, although the Steam Overlay didn't seem to work for me. On Steam Deck, they're working on support but it's not yet ready. They <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2849680/discussions/0/597386590728345355/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">didn't seem</a> particularly happy last year that Valve already gave it a Playable rating.</p>
<p>Cheap too, with a 30% discount until May 28th and even when not discounted it's very reasonably priced. They even note this as a feature: "reasonably priced to help offset the unreasonable cost of everything else".</p>
<p>I just can't get over the atmosphere of it. Brilliant.</p>

      <title>You are the final boss in Noobs Are Coming, an over the top arena roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Solo developer Overboy has announced that Noobs Are Coming, their chaotic over the top arena roguelike, is set for release in 2025 with full Native Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>They said their main inspiration for the game is basically "The Binding of Isaac X Brotato", and it acts as a spiritual successor to their viral-hit game <a href="https://overboy.itch.io/mobs-inc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mobs Inc</a> from 10 years ago. Set in their own parody RPG universe, the point is to make unique broken builds across various different runs with each run being wildly different. The characters you play as are just as over the top as the builds you can make like a giant worm or a huge spider.</p>
<p>It supports solo play and local co-op for up to 4 players (or Steam Remote Play Together).</p>
<p>A new trailer is also live now:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n697S0D_amM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13f27031fdde1f183d17baf7fbb4d236.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n697S0D_amM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As a big fan of Brotato and Isaac, I'm definitely keen to see what kind of madness this will offer.</p>
<p>The game is due for release in June but no specific date has been given yet.</p>

      <title>Chaotic spider-physics sandbox A Webbing Journey is out now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game that finally made me think a Spider could be adorable? Nah, they still terrify me, but A Webbing Journey really is wholesome. Great idea for a game too with some fun physics and web-slinging.</p>
<p>Squirt webs all over the place, swing around and crawl over every surface in this sandbox game — you're a tiny critter on a big mission to help your favourite humans. This includes tasks like baking, doing the dishes and watering plants. All the things spiders can apparently do? No task is too big they say. If only spiders in my house were this helpful! Instead of hiding in my shoes or dropping on my head just as I'm falling asleep.</p>

<p>Created by Fire Totem Games, a small indie game studio from Austria, founded by a group of friends with a shared love and passion for video games. The company was founded initially as a solo dev studio in 2017, later expanding to a six-person studio. Through a series of innovative and exciting experiments, the team eventually conceived the prototype for A Webbing Journey, which has since grown into their first commercial game and it's out now in Early Access with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Mineshaft is a tough but unique Tetris-like with crafting and mining for gems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mineshaft is a clever blending of genres that takes the very basics from Tetris but makes it quite an interesting challenge with resource gathering, tool crafting and puzzle solving. It's like a mini Minecraft / Terraria version of Tetris. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Here you have the standard falling blocks of different shapes, but these shapes have raw resources in them. Combine them in the right way and you can craft various tools, which will allow you to actually dig deeper into the map to collect more resources to keep going and go through quests.</p>
<p>It's quite different and a really nice spin on things and even includes local split-screen PvP battles.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DtHGHOPsgeo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/56a1755f151a879846cb5fb6ec147c72.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DtHGHOPsgeo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Blocks aren't set in place when they drop either, so if you drop a shape on top of a single block, the rest will fall down the sides with physics. This is where the nice combo feature can come into play. A well-placed block can end up giving you multiple tools in a row, which can really help you break through the lines to get deeper. It's tough though to focus on multiple things as the same time, while quite a casual game, it really is a thorough challenge to get through even the earliest levels.</p>
<p>There's a lot of content already included with you dropping blocks across around 64 map locations, with various different biomes to drop blocks and mine through. There's also a whole shop and upgrade system to help you on your way. As you collect resources and then craft some coins, you'll be able to upgrade the equipment you can craft during a run to give you a lot of advantages - but still remains tough due to how you have to match up all the resources when dropping those blocks.</p>
<p>If you love a casual but engaging challenge and a fun spin on a classic it's one to take a look at. There's also a demo available and the game is currently in Early Access.</p>
<p><em>Played on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck with Proton, it worked perfectly.</em></p>

      <title>Sirocco Thugs is an upcoming first-person boomer beat &#39;em up with a demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a focus on flashy kicking, punching and beating, Sirocco Thugs could be one to watch if you love boomer shooters but fancy smacking people with a lead pipe or knuckledusters instead while you do combos. There's a demo available on Steam right now and it works on Linux with Proton.</p>
<p><em>I especially like that the developer is called BRIAN DAMAGE — heh.</em></p>
<p>The developer says it takes place "in an authentic Southern Italian setting, the game puts you in the shoes of one man - Tugg DiMamma - embarking on a quest for revenge". You'll brawl your way through various hordes of thugs, and eventually come face-to-face with "the Don".</p>

      <title>Beyond All Reason, a free and open source RTS gets a big visual overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Beyond All Reason is an incredibly impressive free and open source RTS, with The Lightbringer update out now that's a huge advancement for the visuals. <em>If you love massive battles you need to play this one.</em></p>
<p>The update was getting so big, they've had to split it into multiple parts, mainly because they kept on adding more.</p>
<p>A full day / night cycle system should come in Part 2. For Part 1 that's out now you can look forward to seeing dynamic animated detail lights on units and buildings, with the developers noting they've added in "over 3,000 individual lights across nearly 400 units" and it looks seriously cool. On top of that there's screen-space raytraced shadows (SSRTX), shockwaves and heat distortions, major performance improvements for the UI along with it being clearer to read and lots more smaller details.</p>
<p>The amount of players continues to grow too. They said they've seen the daily active player count double since the start of 2025, "now surpassing 15,000 every single day".</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer</p>

<p>While the game is technically considered in Alpha, it's fully playable and has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>It will release on Steam eventually but they still have a lot of work ahead. For now, download direct.</p>

      <title>Microsoft finally solve the Linux dual-boot issue after 9 months</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in August 2024, Microsoft released an update for various versions of Windows including Windows 10 and 11 that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/microsoft-breaks-some-linux-dual-boots-in-a-recent-windows-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">broke dual-booting with Linux</a> on some setups. They've now finally solved it. <em>Only took them 9 months.</em></p>
<p>The issue came from a Windows security <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-server-2022#3377msgdesc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a>, something that was not supposed to affect systems where it detected a dual-boot but Microsoft failed on that causing problems for many to be unable to boot into their Linux installs. </p>
<p>From Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After installing the August 2024 Windows security update, (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/5041160" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">KB5041160</a>) or the August 2024 preview update, you might face issues with booting Linux if you have enabled the dual-boot setup for Windows and Linux in your device. Resulting from this issue, your device might fail to boot Linux and show the error message “Verifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation. Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation.”</p>
<p>The August 2024 Windows security and preview updates apply a Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) setting to devices that run Windows to block old, vulnerable boot managers. This SBAT update will not be applied to devices where dual booting is detected. On some devices, the dual-boot detection did not detect some customized methods of dual-booting and applied the SBAT value when it should not have been applied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft did tweak this so that from September 19, 2024 and later updates did not do this automatically, but the damage was already done.</p>
<p>As of the May 13, 2025 <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/may-13-2025-kb5058385-os-build-20348-3692-45f3b455-92fa-4297-9dde-1428b36e53ad" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> for Windows, this has now been solved. As the changelog notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) and Linux Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI)]</strong> This update applies improvements to SBAT for the detection of Linux systems.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck / SteamOS hits 19,000 games rated Verified and Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for players on Steam Deck and SteamOS, as the Steam Deck Verified system just hit 19,000 games that are rated either Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>Valve did also just recently announce a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/valve-announce-steamos-compatibility-ratings-an-extension-of-steam-deck-verified-for-more-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new dedicated SteamOS Compatibility</a> system too, although that will simply say if something is compatible or not. So if a game is Steam Deck Playable at least (or higher like Verified), it will also be SteamOS Compatible. At the end of April we also had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/proton-10-gets-a-first-beta-to-improve-game-compatibility-on-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first Proton 10 Beta</a> to increase game compatibility!</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">At time of writing there are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Playable 12,841</li>
<li>Verified 6,216</li>
<li>Unsupported 4,798</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of those that are Unsupported will be <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">due to the anti-cheat</a>.</p>
