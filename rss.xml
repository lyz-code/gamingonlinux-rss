      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII arrives February 11, 2025 - Gameplay reveal trailer live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Gameplay reveal trailer has been released for Sid Meier's Civilization VII and we have a release date of February 11th, 2025. Some other good news is there will be no extra launcher this time too (and it was recently removed from the previous game), although they are requiring a 2K account for online play.</p>
<p>Check out the first gameplay below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kK_JrrP9m2U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e11196832bbe950cc97a4bb7df59d8c8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's available to pre-order starting from £59.99 / 69,99€ / $69.99 and more for the other editions of the game. The Deluxe and Founders edition give a bunch of extras, along with Advanced Access to get into the game on February 5th.</p>
<p>Their previous press releases very clearly mentioned Linux support and the pre-order on Steam has the SteamOS (Linux) icon too, so as far as I know, it will have Linux support again but it's not been stated who is doing it if it will be Firaxis Games themselves, Aspyr Media again or another team. The Linux system requirements are just noted as "TDB" (Windows and macOS are the same).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Path of Exile 2 hits Early Access on November 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know lots of action-RPG fans will be excited for this one. Path of Exile 2 is now set to release into Early Access on November 15th. Hopefully it will work well, if they kept up with their Vulkan support it would make it a lot easier to run through <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>MudRunner and SnowRunner creator announced RoadCraft a heavy machinery construction sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh, now this looks good! Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment who made the likes of MudRunner and SnowRunner just revealed RoadCraft.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of SnowRunner, despite how terrible I am at it, always getting completely stuck no matter what I do and RoadCraft takes things in a different direction. Instead of just transporting goods from one location to another, you're in charge of rebuilding after natural disasters with various forms of heavy machinery.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ajbx_1Sk1Wo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce7524bcd69effe81bf20b83c2a07ad0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ajbx_1Sk1Wo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebuild devastated areas solo or in co-op mode for up to four players in a simulation featuring advanced physics.</li>
<li>Operate more than 40 vehicles, from bulldozers to construction cranes.</li>
<li>Work in various regions around the world with eight maps, each 4 km² in size.</li>
<li>Manipulate materials such as wood, sand and asphalt using Saber’s new physics engine.</li>
<li>Construct new roads and bridges to facilitate movement across rugged terrain.</li>
<li>Plot point-to-point routes on your map to guide your logistics convoys and recycle every piece of debris into reconstruction materials.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to embark on a new journey with Saber Interactive and announce <em>RoadCraft </em>today at the Opening Night Live 2024,” said John Bert, Managing Director at Focus Entertainment. “Saber’s experience combined with our expertise in the genre will pave the way for the success of this new franchise and allow players to discover a deep construction simulation experience.”</p>
<p>"Saber continues to explore ways to innovate using our industry-leading off-road simulation technology," said Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive. "We are constantly in search of new and fun types of gameplay experiences that complement our best-selling titles, such as <em>SnowRunner </em>and <em>MudRunner</em>. <em>RoadCraft </em>is our first foray into heavy equipment simulation. The game provides the best combination of off-road and construction simulations to create a new experience unlike anything that has preceded it.”</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2104890/RoadCraft/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will release sometime in 2025. You'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> to play it on Desktop Linux / Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Kyle Crane returns in Dying Light: The Beast</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Techland are bringing back the original protagonist in Dying Light: The Beast, with you once again jumping into the shoes of Kyle Crane.</p>
<p>You are Kyle Crane, the man whose selflessness during the initial virus outbreak saved many from a fate worse than death. After more than a decade in captivity, you find yourself in a world that’s changed, and not for the better. Now, you’ll need to use the survival skills that kept you alive all those years ago to save even more innocent lives.</p>
<p>Voice actor Roger Craig Smith is returning for Kyle Crane too! Here's what they said: "Stepping back into Kyle Crane's shoes feels like a reunion with an old friend," Smith said. "And even though he’s gone through a terrible time, there’s still plenty of legendary hero left in him.”</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="c50gFkG91jc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a869999707184903985e867e08b5d490.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/c50gFkG91jc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This was actually supposed to be a DLC for Dying Light 2 but Techland said "after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience". If you own the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, you'll get it free.</p>
<p>Sounds like it will be quite unique in the series too with you having transformation abilities: "They caged you like an animal. Years of brutal experimentation took its toll, but the zombie DNA and yours are now intertwined so that you are able to unleash a beast-like power. It flows through your veins. No one can take it from you. Use it. And you’ll discover it’s not just a curse.".</p>
<p>No release date yet, we'll find out more later this year. Plenty of time for Valve to ensure <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> is in a good state to have it work at release. <em>And time for me to actually finish Dying Light 2…</em></p>

      <title>Borderlands 4 is coming in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gearbox and 2K today announced Borderlands 4 is real and it's going to release sometime in 2025 although we don't know many details yet. Hopefully it will work okay with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>After the absolute disaster that was the Borderlands movie, no doubt fans are itching for something less terrible to blast through. The Steam store page doesn't exactly give much away just noting the obvious: "See if you have what it takes to go down in history as a legendary Vault Hunter as you search for secret alien treasure, blasting everything in sight."</p>
<p>See the new teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1Q8WImF649E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f653bd903bf1712da7c4588e371c8044.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1Q8WImF649E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>What are you hoping to see from it? It's been a few years since the last mainline game, Borderlands 3, which released back in 2019.</p>
<p>You can get a whole lot of Borderlands real cheap right now on <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/franchises/borderlands?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/Borderlands" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Starground blends together factory building automation with dungeon crawling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Build a factory, get it automated and go on an adventure? Sure why not! Starground will give you exactly that alone or with friends. While it completely failed to get anywhere on Kickstarter, the developer didn't give up and it's now in Early Access on Steam with Native Linux support.</p>
<p><em>It's another game built with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>!</em></p>
<p>More about it: "Starground is a top-down automation dungeon crawler combo. Alternate between gathering and refining resources on your home planet, and venturing across space to fight through action roguelite-inspired dungeons. How you split your time is entirely up to you! There's no right way to play the game, and any path will progress the story."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YXyu4bXAWdg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b81046afd5b17268b3d1548263afbaf7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YXyu4bXAWdg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>MULTIPLAYER - Starground was built up with multiplayer from the beginning. Experience what Starground has to offer as a full co-operative experience with as many friends as you'd like. Invite your friends to work towards common goals, or divide and conquer each part of the game. If multiplayer isn't your thing though, you can play alone in single player too!</li>
<li>AUTOMATION - Develop and maximize an island of resources through automation. Work your way through a research tree filled with all sorts of unique machines and solutions to your logistical needs. Start humble by mining resources by hand and smelting manually, but soon build up to a formidable factory that can tackle anything you can throw at it.</li>
<li>DUNGEONS - If you're not into automation, or need to wait for your factory, then venture to other places in the solar system to explore and crawl your way through a variety of dungeons. Battle enemies, avoid obstacles, kill bosses, and reap the rewards of your effort. Take resources from dungeons back to your factory, or use rare loot to make yourself stronger and craft modular weapons. Make a spear, dual-bladed sword, or maybe a gun on a stick. The choice is yours.</li>
</ul>

<p>I saw only recently a few comments asking for something similar to this, so perhaps this may be what some GamingOnLinux readers have been after.</p>

      <title>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire looks like Steamboat Willie as a FPS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of MOUSE: P.I. For Hire, originally just known as MOUSE, certainly aren't shying away from their retro Disney inspiration here. With Steamboat Willie now in the public domain, we can bet there will be more that use classic Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p>You still have quite a while to wait on it though, since it's not going to release until 2025. Reminds me in a few ways of what <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/bye-sweet-carole-blends-horror-with-what-looks-like-classic-disney-movies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bye Sweet Carole is doing</a> with the classic Disney style.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19543006671724174956gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More about it: "MOUSE: P.I. For Hire, a gritty and noir-fueled FPS shooter that draws inspiration from classic cartoons of the 1930s.</p>
<p>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire boasts a unique visual style inspired by the charm of 1930s rubber hose animation, transporting players to a nostalgic era of early cartoons. Assume the role of a private detective navigating a noir city teeming with gangs, mobs, and characters from the dark side. Unravel a quest for justice in a noir city mired in chaos, corruption, and vibrant energy, utilizing a diverse arsenal of weapons, power-ups, and explosives to thwart the takeover by corrupt politicians. The game's playful weaponry and distinctive health display, coupled with enemies behaving like cartoon characters, add a lighthearted twist to traditional FPS gameplay."</p>
<p>A brand new trailer was just shown off too, take a look below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8-ueTky6eEk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fe434eb44cbbd4d4470131ed0f5cead8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8-ueTky6eEk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416450/MOUSE_PI_For_Hire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Hopefully it will run fine on Desktop Linux / Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Announced today is Elevator Down, a game the developer claims is like Papers, Please blended with The Good Place. They told me via email "The game will be released with 100% support on both Linux and the Steam Deck".</p>
<p>Coming from Greek indie studio eNVy softworks, Elevator Down is a a satirical bureaucratic simulation game where you're the newest recruit in the Afterlife's least glamorous department: Life Evaluation. Talk to Souls, check their documents, reference Holy Texts and decide if they're going Up or Down. Follow the Rules or trust your own moral compass and see where your choices take you - hopefully not the express elevator to hell.…</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paperwork Purgatory: </strong>Tackle mountains of forms, holy texts and absurdly specific guidelines to determine where each Soul belongs. Of course, you can always wing it and hope for the best… </li>
<li><strong>Divine Dilemmas: </strong>Come face to face with Souls begging you not to send them Down. What is more important, the Rules or Justice? Have you entered your Villain Era and are now sending everyone Down? </li>
<li><strong>Soul Parade:</strong> Meet an eclectic mix of characters from every corner of the Afterlife, each with their own sob stories and supernatural quirks. Who knows? Maybe amongst them you might find the love of your [after]life!</li>
<li><strong>Eternal Endings: </strong>Every choice counts, with multiple possible outcomes that determine your own Afterlife fate. Mess up too bad and maybe even the entire World could be at stake! No pressure.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Descent 3 open source project gets a first release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After getting open sourced back in April and now run as a community project, the Descent 3 open source engine has a first release available. You do need a copy of the game to run it which you can get from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/descent_3_expansion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/273590/Descent_3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>This open source release also includes the "1.5" patch written by Kevin Bentley and Jeff Slutter several years ago and brought to a stable condition by the Descent community.</p>
<p>So what's actually in this new 1.5 release? They said in the release notes that it "fills in the gaps left in the never-released 1.5 patch of the game, and makes it more accessible and convenient to run on modern devices". Their main focus was to get it running properly on modern CPUs and improve the developer experience. Thanks to the work "Descent 3 now runs on 64-bit Linux, Windows and MacOS using SDL2, on AMD64 as well as ARM64 CPUs" with 32bit support dropped.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5183365391724173270gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Also now available is a <a href="https://github.com/DescentDevelopers/Descent3/discussions/531" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roadmap</a> towards the next release which includes plans for a graphics renderer rewrite to use more modern OpenGL, support for higher screen resolutions, localization support improvements and more.</p>
<p>Will be fun to see this classic see a new life!</p>

      <title>Canonical bring more Steam Snap improvements, also hiring more Desktop Software Engineers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical developers continue working towards Ubuntu 24.10, the next release of the popular Linux distribution, and thankfully more fixes are coming for the Steam Snap package.</p>
<p>Mentioned in an <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-desktop-s-24-10-dev-cycle-part-4-august-update/47217" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> in the Ubuntu Discourse forum, Oliver Smith who is the Interim Engineering Director for Ubuntu Desktop, talked about issues with Snap + NVIDIA + Steam. The team has worked on a "more permissive AppArmor profile" for the Steam Snap package to "grant broader permissions to the snap" and that this "looks to resolve a majority of outstanding game compatibility issues that were not present in the Steam deb".</p>
<p>So hopefully, this will mean the Steam Snap package, that Canonical promoted from experimental to stable, will actually be properly usable soon.</p>
<p>It was also mentioned how they found issues with the NVIDIA 550 driver, which have been fixed. Thankfully that's coming sooner rather than later with a newer version of snapd that will arrive before Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS. Additionally there's some better testing in place now for future driver updates.</p>
<p>Thanks to all this they "expect a significant improvement in the quality of compatibility of the Steam snap".</p>
<p>Also, if you're looking for a job, Canonical are again hiring for more <a href="https://canonical.com/careers/all?filter=Engineering" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Desktop Software Engineers</a>.</p>
<p><em>Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS is due out on August 29th.</em></p>

      <title>Check out the fancy new trailer for Beyond All Reason a really great free and open source RTS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Beyond All Reason is quietly building up to be one of the best real-time strategy (RTS) games around. It's free, open source and it has a fancy new trailer.</p>
<p>Technically, it's nowhere near finished as a game, they call it "Alpha+" but it's extremely playable and is a huge amount of fun to send massive armies across the map. I've been playing it for quite some time now and really enjoy their attention to the details.</p>
<p>A lot of history to this one too going all the way back to the 1997 classic Total Annihilation. Beyond All Reason originally used the <a href="https://springrts.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SpringRTS</a> (Spring Engine) game engine, which itself started off life as a 3D game engine for classic Total Annihilation. Beyond All Reason is also a fork of Balanced Annihilation, a mod for SpringRTS. Nowadays it runs on <a href="https://beyond-all-reason.github.io/spring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recoil</a>, a "hard fork of Spring".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Finally. After over a year of waiting, FINAL FANTASY XVI is now confirmed to be releasing on PC on September 17. If you want to see how well it will work with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Desktop Linux or Steam Deck, there's a demo available right now too.</p>

Before long, Clive will be caught up in a great tragedy and swear revenge on the Dark Eikon Ifrit, a mysterious entity that brings calamity in its wake.</p>

      <title>Get ready to collect some Rabbits in Usagi Shima: Bunny Island</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Usagi Shima: Bunny Island is a game I've been following for quite some time, as it looks adorable (and as a Rabbit owner I couldn't resist) and it finally has a Steam page. Currently available on mobile platforms, it was built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> so hopefully they won't have too much trouble with a PC release, which will come with Linux support too.</p>
<p>A nice relaxing casual game for those of you who prefer the more chilled side of gaming. As the developer said: "It is heavily inspired by cute, soothing games like Neko Atsume and Animal Crossing. The game’s namesake and setting draws inspiration from Ōkunoshima (大久野島), a real island in Japan that has a lot of bunny inhabitants!"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gkRf3wuNpro"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aa17a1020be442c6724055e0cb2e35b9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gkRf3wuNpro" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover and collect 30+ rabbits with unique looks and features!</li>
<li>Collect 100+ items to decorate with, some even interactive!</li>
<li>Pet, feed, brush, and play hide and seek with the bunnies to build friendship.</li>
<li>Dress up your bunnies with adorable hats!</li>
<li>Receive keepsakes from bunnies you’ve become best friends with, and even invite them to stay on your island.</li>
<li>Take snapshots to build an adorable photo album and even make the captured photos into device wallpapers.</li>
<li>Hand-drawn and traditionally animated art style.</li>
<li>Synced with real-time, experience the island ambience that matches your time of day.</li>
<li>Cozy idle gameplay with no time limits, no stress, peaceful and soothing to play at your own pace!</li>
</ul>

<p>The PC release likely isn't until 2025, so you've got a while to wait yet. Worth the wait hopefully though, as it's <em>very</em> highly rated on mobile.</p>

      <title>Colony building sim Odd Realm is officially out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Early Access for a few years, Unknown Origin Games have now fully launched their mystical colony sim Odd Realm.</p>
<p>A pretty complex game inspired by the likes of RimWorld and Dwarf Fortress, it's one where you could end up spending days in it. Start off with nothing, and eventually watch as your little pixel people do your bidding and build up a big bustling colony. Dig deep for riches and watch out for some less than friendly neighbours.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer for the 1.0 release:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="opFFQLdP-5M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/82ed98142d827172cfc123504e562ce8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/opFFQLdP-5M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the release the developer said: "I started making this little game at the beginning of 2017. I didn't know what I was getting into at the time, but I knew I wanted to make a colony sim set in a strange, little fantasy world. It has been a monumental challenge, and it's because of your constant patience and encouragement that I was able to get to 1.0. Especially over the last several months where players have helped me find bugs in the beta or simply kept me company. So, for that, truly, a genuine thank you to all of you.</p>
<p>And if you are a new player, thank you for playing my game. It means a great deal to me.</p>
<p>Now, this isn't the end. We are just getting cooking! If you've read my previous posts, you know that there's a lot planned for upcoming versions of the game."</p>
<p>The developer confirmed more is coming including another playable race, overworld conquest, deeper history and events, modding support, localization and more content overall.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Current features:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 races to start your kingdom with, each with unique playstyles.</li>
<li>Unlimited procedurally generated deserts, mountains, tropical islands, and frozen tundras.</li>
<li>Dynamic weather and seasons unique to each biome.</li>
<li>Hundreds of plants, animals, and items.</li>
<li>A research tree with options for each race that unlock new blueprints and rooms.</li>
<li>Outfit individual settlers with tools, weapons, and gear.</li>
<li>Manage your kingdom and view other kingdoms on an expansive world map.</li>
<li>Battle raiders, invading armies, and underground horrors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Odd Realm has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>Available to buy from</p>

      <title>GOG confirm Resident Evil 2 re-release date for August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news retro game lovers, as <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> have now confirmed that <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/resident_evil_2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil 2</a> is due to get its re-release on August 27th.

<p>Like with the first, GOG are ensuring there's a bunch of updates to get it working nicely including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>6 localizations of the game included (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese).</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For Linux Desktop and Steam Deck players, you'll need Wine / Proton to play it, but hopefully this will be the best edition of the classic given that impressive sounding list. Getting GOG games on Linux is pretty darn easy with my favourite <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/heroic-games-launcher-v215-has-expanded-gog-support-ea-games-from-epic-store-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher which only just had some big GOG improvements</a> too.</p>

      <title>shapez 2 is an absurdly great and accessible factory-building game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to cut some shapes, and I don't mean on the dance floor. Factory-building sim shapez 2 is out now in Early Access with Linux support. <em>Note: Key provided by GameDriveNL.</em></p>
<p>The idea here is that there's this big swirly hungry vortex, it's desperately hungry for some shapes, and it's your job to pull them all out and send them into the void. How you go about that is your choice, it mostly leaves you to just chill out and have fun building these massive ridiculous sprawling factories across a gigantic map.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15528492201723827823gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15528492201723827823gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Stacking circles on top of squares, and cutting squares into tiny squares.</em></p>
<p>shapez 2 has done something truly quite exceptional here. Not only has improved on the idea of the first game in pretty much every possible way, it's done so while adding deeper gameplay mechanics and moved it from 2D to full 3D. I'm honestly astonished at every part of it. Not only does it run really well, but it looks quite pretty too. Seeing all sorts of shapes flowing across the map is quite mesmerising.</p>
<p>The way everything just flows is impressive, and how it eases you into it carefully but quite quickly you soon get to grips with the mechanics. That's also thanks to the very clear interface, clearly a lot of attention has gone into all the little things with shapez 2. Plenty of clear and easily explained details from the in-game guide for any time you lost too.</p>
<p>Not only is it now in 3D, but it's multi-layered too, so you'll be building conveyor belts on top of other belts, dropping things on top of each other. But even there, the controls and UI are really super-simple to understand and it just makes it so satisfying to play. I will admit there was a brief bit of confusion there, but again due to how clear the UI and style of the game is, it's not frustrating, and there's no punishments, you just delete a few belts and re-do it quickly and easily.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SFoml48FR2M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/be3417b8476aac2e78935fe3a3aa1d65.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SFoml48FR2M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Once you really get going, giving you a chance to sit back and what all the moving pieces while you progress through the next shape quest, it feels like watching a fancy Rube Goldberg machine, like being a child again watching marbles just fall through various things to eventually drop into something.</p>
<p>It takes the most basic elements of Factorio, Satisfactory and other similar titles and really distils it into the purest form of factory building. One that's great for the more casual audience, but just as engrossing for those who love the chaos that can come from others, it just has a bit of everything but with no pesky aliens to worry about coming along and wrecking your perfect designs.</p>
<p>Current features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Layer 3D Factories:</strong> Design and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension.</li>
<li><strong>Trains: </strong>Connect distant stations with a network of space trains.</li>
<li><strong>Research System:</strong> Unlock buildings, mechanics &amp; upgrades in the all-new tech tree.</li>
<li><strong>New Shape Mechanics: </strong>Discover new shapes types with unique properties and logic.</li>
<li><strong>Blueprint Library: </strong>Save, load, export and share factory design blueprints with anyone.</li>
<li><strong>All-new Visuals: </strong>Build factories and stations in a stunning immersive space environment.</li>
<li><strong>Fluids: </strong>Use different types of liquids to process shapes or boost production.</li>
<li><strong>Animated Open Buildings: </strong>See what's happening inside buildings in your factory.</li>
<li><strong>Easy editing: </strong>Cutting, cloning, rotating and destroying sections of your factory has never been so intuitive.</li>
<li><strong>Undo/Redo: </strong>Gain the ability to undo/redo unwanted operations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Native Linux version tested, I've not encountered any problems. It's silky smooth, looks good, performs well and no graphical issues noted. Probably one of the best launches (especially for Early Access) that I've seen for some time. There's a lot to like about this one that I can truly see myself spending numerous hours in.</p>
<p>From the press release: Tobias Springer, founder of tobspr Games, said “We’re very excited and proud to have finally launched shapez 2 into Early Access. This game has been a labor of love so we couldn’t be happier with what we have managed to deliver to our players at Early Access launch. The game is already in a fantastic state but as we move forward, we are going to continue to develop it by listening to our community and implementing features that will make it even better for both our fans and those new to the factory building genre. We’re hugely thankful for the support we have received so far and look forward to continuing building shapez 2 into an even more satisfying strategy experience”.</p>
<p>No surprise to see before publishing the article, a quick check on Steam shows an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating. One I truly think is 100% deserves here.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors gets free content in The Darkasso update, online co-op still in development </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The game that started it all and has been cloned repeatedly, Vampire Survivors has another free update out with The Darkasso update. After some truly cryptic and confusing teasers, the developers have now properly announced it.</p>
<p>Non-spoilery version of what's in the update::</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>9 new EXTRA achievements</li>
<li>1 new challenge stage</li>
<li>1 new relic</li>
<li>2 new special character skins</li>
<li>5 new Arcanas</li>
<li>🦇🦇🦇</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And they have another ridiculous trailer to go along with it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZY-SoV-A39s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3c0d76a08e1c88ad4356540befe8606d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZY-SoV-A39s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For those waiting on the online co-op support, they said it's still progressing well but too early to give details. As for other things to come, they're still being quite secretive there, other than saying "we have put one on hold, substituted another one, two are still ongoing, and finally we have greenlit 2 of them" with more details coming in 2025 on whatever it is.</p>
<p>They also joked how they basically throw darts on their roadmap on what to pick:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2388482051723821064gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2388482051723821064gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Other bug fixes and improvements from patch 1.11 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Obtaining the Yellow Sign also allows to see if a treasure chest has the potential to contain an evolution (Silver Chests)<br/>
- Carréllo projectiles won't be destroyed anymore when they hit the top or bottom edge of the screen<br/>
- GoldFingers are now pulled into Mad Groove, unless spawned directly on the map (e.g. Astral Stair ones are ignored)<br/>
- Fix for negative coin values (added correction on save data load)<br/>
- Fixed dodgy price formatting on powerups<br/>
- Fix for controller navigation on long lists on the recap page<br/>
- Fix for displaying over 5 arcanas in pause page<br/>
- Fix inversion of trigger zones in stages with visual inversion not allowed<br/>
- Fixed bestiary text overflow<br/>
- Fix for Pentagram scaring the rising water but not the Drowner<br/>
- Various fixes to Arcana selection and draft screens<br/>
- Various fixes to cursor navigation when playing co-op<br/>
- Stacking multiples of the same added weapons in recap screen (eg candy box)<br/>
- [Moonspell] Nightsword and Muramasa deal bonus damage depending on Greed<br/>
- [Foscari] Fixed collision shape and stats scaling of SpellStream<br/>
- [Foscari] Fixed Insatiable by making magnet values match original intended JS version<br/>

      <title>Get ready to paint the world in tracks with Super Loco World from the Farlanders creator</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of Farlanders, Andriy Bychkovskyi, has revealed their next game with Super Loco World, a train building management and automation sim. With a soft casual style it looks quite inviting, but that definitely seems like it hides the complexities of it. For anyone who loves traffic management sims, railroad tycoon-styled games, this may be one for you.</p>
<p>Unlike some other games, the trains won't magically be able to turn around. So here, you really have the challenge of not only getting trains from station to station across a dynamic world, but you need to ensure they can actually get back the other way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5761523191723815009gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5761523191723815009gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1696140041723815011gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1696140041723815011gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that, there's a lot of management and automation at play here. You need to set all their speeds, manage the junctions, rail signals and much more. The developer mentioned how you're free to experiment with it as the game "encourages creativity and does not penalize you for rebuilding railroads or infrastructure".</p>
<p>As you build up your networks the world evolves with you with expanding villages that grow into small town and eventually bigger. Trains actually consume fuel here too, so you'll need stations for that, along with the money to keep it all ticking over. However, as a nice little accessibility feature, fuel cost can be turned off.</p>
<p>Each time is fresh too with the game world and resource distribution being randomly generated.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L0KZyRC55ng"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9d17a02b4b4b8e908732ce0f75ac7ee3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L0KZyRC55ng" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer told me over email it will have full Native Linux support. Sounds like a nice one to keep an eye on. Looks really quite charming.</p>

      <title>These new Factorio enemies coming in Factorio: Space Age look horrifying</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Factorio is a game about building and automating, but it's also all about defending from vicious aliens and the new lot coming in Factorio: Space Age look like the stuff of nightmares.</p>
<p>The developers have been showing off some of the new planets coming with the expansion that's due in October, and one planet they've been highlighting recently is <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-413" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gleba</a>. Originally known internally as the "biological planet", it looks a whole lot more alive than other planets. In fact, it looks really gross and vibrant and I can't wait to explore and cover it with belts.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-424" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest developer diary</a>, the team showed off some of the horrors that will await you on planet Gleba. And uh, you're going to need some firepower to deal with them. Based on "distant relatives of starfish or seastars", you'll be facing off against small and rather large 5-legged Pentapods.</p>
<p>Since Factorio will have multiple planets in the expansion, the developers are doing some interesting balancing work on the enemies here. As you might face them late in the game when you're fully equipped, or you might go in a bit under-prepared depending on where you expand. Thankfully, these new beasties won't seek you out right away to devour you, instead mainly focusing on protecting their nests or nearby allies. As the developer said they are "fairly passive" but "If you do fight them and win then they will evolve".</p>
<p>Have a look at them below:</p>

      <title>Chilled castle doodling game Tiny Glade releases September 23 and the demo is back</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Glade is a wonderful idea, letting you just chilled out and doodle castles with their fantastic tools and it's now set to launch on September 23. It's also one of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most wishlisted</a> games on Steam, after the demo clearly hooked a lot of people in.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2198150/view/6124418777150844821" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Announced</a> on Steam as part of the Wholesome Games Festival, the demo is back up again and will be until it releases so you can get a taste of it again. It also has full Native Linux support. The demo was also updated with "small birdies, trapdoors, ability to move freehand walls, color lanterns, and many other tweaks across the smörgåsbord" so you may want to re-try it anyway.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CdWpq2efN8Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3320c22e3b2f4c041ffa8fcb1f88e0c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CdWpq2efN8Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tiny Glade is a relaxing free-form building game. Tap into the joy of making something pretty with no management, no combat, or wrong answers - just kick back, doodle some castles, and turn forgotten meadows into lovable dioramas.</p>
<p>Explore gridless building chemistry, and watch the game carefully assemble every brick, pebble and plank. Draw a path through a wall? An arch pops up! Widen the arch? Pillars line up. Lower the wall? Arches turn into fences and gates.</p>
<p>There are no wrong answers or failure states. You can change your mind at any time, and whatever you make will look cozy out of the box.</p>

      <title>Free classic RTS OpenRA mod &#39;Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms&#39; has a huge overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love your classic RTS games, especially those from Westwood like Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert, you need to play the <a href="https://www.openra.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenRA</a> mod Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms. <em>This standalone game mod for the open source OpenRA bundles in so much it's crazy.</em></p>
<p>Going over the changelog, it's quite ridiculous the amount that's included in this update. There's new artwork and visual effects, various new units across each faction, new structures, new gameplay mechanics and the list goes on.</p>
<p>One of the major additions is a change to the ranking system and upgrades. The Soviet side has an entirely new ranking system with more depth, while the Allied and Scrin factions now feature mutually exclusive upgrade paths, offering greater variety and strategic choices in the high-tech endgame. These enhancements will provide fresh tactical options and new ways to customize your forces.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13709213001723806588gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13709213001723806588gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

      <title>Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged releases September 19</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to go on an adventure? Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged from Revolution Software Ltd is ready to release on September 19. A complete remaster of the original, first in the series, it comes complete with Native Linux support.</p>

<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Point and click offers a simple interface from which captivating, challenging gameplay emerges,” says Charles Cecil, founder and CEO of Revolution Software. “But the user experience has remained unchanged since the ‘90s when Broken Sword redefined the genre. Our research suggested that gamers now prefer a more contemporary experience. Broken Sword has a hugely passionate fan base, which runs over three generations. With these graphic and user experience enhancements, we look forward to hearing from fans once the game crosses over, once again, to a fourth generation who love narrative-driven games.”</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown 1896 broke on Linux / Steam Deck, here&#39;s the quick fix for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 17/08/24, 9:00 UTC</strong>: Proton Hotfix was updated with the needed fix to get it working. Valve has set this by default for it so you should uncheck any forced compatibility options you have set. Nice to see Valve react so quickly once again.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown had a huge update and rebranded to Hunt: Showdown 1896, but the update came with breakage on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Valve have been really quick at times when this sort of thing happens to bigger games. And once again, Valve to the rescue. Use this fix at your own risk though, as it can cause other issues, it will also affect any other games you currently have set to Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>For the fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Proton Experimental in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go into Properties -&gt; Betas.</li>
<li>Select the "bleeding-edge latest and untested dxvk, vkd3d-proton and wine changes; backup your prefixes before using" (not the 8.0 version!).</li>
<li>Then ensure Proton Experimental has updated.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19425189781723801884gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19425189781723801884gol1.png"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>After that, find Hunt: Showdown 1896 in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go into Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the box and select Proton Experimental.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20752440071723801978gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20752440071723801978gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>After that, you'll be good to go. No doubt a fresh normal version of Proton Experimental will come soon so that first part eventually won't be needed.</p>
<p>What's new in the game? Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Map – Mammon's Gulch, a whole new biome set in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado.</li>
<li>New Wild Target – the Hellborn is Hunt's newest Wild Target who uses an onslaught of fiery attacks. Once downed, the Hellborn will grant a Bounty Token with no Banish time.</li>
<li>Scorched Earth – a new Live Event giving players brand-new rewards to earn.</li>
<li>New CRYEINGINE 5.11 integration – ushering in upgraded visuals, audio, performance, and more.</li>
<li>New UI - overhauled to improve navigation, with plenty more updates to come.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the trailer for the new update:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="16vBsmpcxh4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d7e8b8499d36f5460941ceba538b761.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/16vBsmpcxh4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Valve released Windows drivers for Steam Deck OLED but no official support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it is not in any way officially supported by Valve, they have now released Windows drivers for the newer Steam Deck OLED model.</p>
<p>Since the Steam Deck ships with SteamOS (Linux) out of the box, and all of Valve's work goes into that, you're basically on your own if you choose to put Windows on the Steam Deck OLED. As per the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6121-ECCD-D643-BAA8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support page</a>, they note very clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are providing these resources as is and are unfortunately unable to offer 'Windows on Deck' support. If you get stuck and need a way back to the default Steam Deck OS, please follow <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">these recovery instructions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This is the same status for the original Steam Deck LCD model.</em></p>
<p>If you do wish to do so, you'll need to first update to SteamOS 3.6.9+ (currently in Beta/Preview), which includes the latest firmware. The drivers for Windows also need a <em>manual</em> download for each one including: APU, Audio, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth drivers. Currently though, the audio drivers only enable audio via headphones or Bluetooth, work for the speakers is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Dual-booting is also still not supported either but that is being worked on still but there's no timeline for it.</p>
<p>If you're thinking about Windows due to other stores and launchers, perhaps first look into the likes of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/heroic-games-launcher-v215-has-expanded-gog-support-ea-games-from-epic-store-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/nonsteamlaunchers-decky-loader-plugin-for-steam-deck-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers</a>.</p>

      <title>Stellaris Cosmic Storms expansion will launch September 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Might be time for another run in Stellaris with the Cosmic Storms announced today to release on September 10th. Developed in collaboration with Behaviour Rotterdam, it's set to expand space weather in a big way.</p>
<p>Not only have they totally overhauled the original Space Storm into an entire system of features, but there's also a new weather map mode for forecasting these storms and predicting their motion, with technologies and buildings to attract, repel, or with an Ascension Perk, even create storms.</p>
<p>While some storm may be bad, not everything will be, some may reveal buried treasures for you or leave planets with new intriguing effects. Check out the release date trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2VfVkAHidAY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0c35fc6ea4a4d230488df7413e988886.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2VfVkAHidAY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What you get with the DLC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NEW STORMS</strong></p>
<p>This expansion adds 8 types of Cosmic Storms (Electric, Particle, Gravity, Magnetic, Radiant, Stardust, Shroud and Nexus) that replace the existing Space Storms, spawning randomly on the map. They travel the galaxy at various speeds, growing and shrinking with time.</p>
<p><strong>STORM CHASER ORIGIN</strong></p>
<p>The Storm Chasers are an empire made of people that seek to push themselves beyond their own limits. They believe enlightenment is found in engaging with the greatest force the universe has to offer: the Cosmic Storms.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>3 NEW CIVICS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Astrometeorology</li>
<li>Storm Devotion</li>
<li>Environmental Architects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2 PRECURSOR NARRATIVES</strong></p>
<p>Discover the stories of the Ancients, vanished masters of the storms: Weather Manipulators and the adAkkaria Convention of Benevolence. The completion of these narratives will unlock a new relic for each.</p>
<p>On top of that, <em>Cosmic Storms</em> adds technologies dedicated to storms, Galactic Community Resolutions, Anomalies, Arc Sites, and Weather Forecast Map Mode. It also adds a new Galactic Weather Control ascension perk, that makes it possible to create cosmic storms with science ships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can pre-purchase for €12.99 / $12.99 / £10.99 or buy it as part of Stellaris: Season 08 - Expansion Pass.</p>
<p>Stellaris has Native Linux support and you can buy it from:</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers Decky Loader plugin for Steam Deck released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making it perhaps easier than ever to get more stores and launchers onto your Steam Deck, the <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers</a> plugin for Decky Loader is now available. It's been in testing for a while, but now it's available in the main Decky Loader store.</p>
<p>It supports installing and setting up Amazon Games Launcher, Battle.net, EA App, Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, Humble Games Collection, IndieGala, itch.io, Rockstar Games, Ubisoft Connect and various others.</p>
<p>You'll need to <em>first</em> install <a href="https://decky.xyz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a>, which is incredibly simple now. Just hit the download on the official site in Desktop Mode, then double-click it to run it from your Downloads folder and follow the plain on-screen instructions. Once done, you can just boot back into Gaming Mode and install NonSteamLaunchers right from the Decky Loader store.</p>
<p>Finding it in the Decky Loader store:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6431428211723732190gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6431428211723732190gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Once installed, it gives you a few different options:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19130586111723732191gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19130586111723732191gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Picking to install the Epic Games Store as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14611314171723732192gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14611314171723732192gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15176184961723732192gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15176184961723732192gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>And finally, there it is all installed for me with a nice shortcut in the Non-Steam part of your Steam Library:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14065529931723732290gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14065529931723732290gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>There's a lot of different stores and launchers, so this really can just help simplify the process. There's other methods of course like the Heroic Games Store for Epic, GOG and Amazon Prime Games but NonSteamLaunchers uses the official launchers run through Proton.</p>
<p>You'll see this addition from <a href="http://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/releases/tag/v3.9.3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers v3.9.3</a> which also includes a few other enhancements.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.3 is out now with huge new features and a fancy release page</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like the Godot team went all-out for the Godot Engine 4.3 release, bringing this royalty-free open source game engine into a bright future.</p>
<p>Their new <a href="https://godotengine.org/releases/4.3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release page</a> is certainly more interesting than before! Instead of paragraphs of text, they more clearly show off all the new stuff included (a bit more like how Blender do their release pages). This is probably the most truly professional I've seen Godot seem.</p>
<p>Some really impressive features added in this release too!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14115793751723729579gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14115793751723729579gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - Godot 4.3, messing with the <a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2755" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Voxel Game Demo</a>.</p>
<p>Some highlights of the new features includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New audio resources to make complex, layered music and transitions.</li>
<li>2D physics interpolation.</li>
<li>An overhauled visual shader editor.</li>
<li>General multi-threading improvements.</li>
<li>More flexible layers for TileMaps.</li>
<li>New skeletal animation import options.</li>
<li>Improved pixel art stability.</li>
<li>Big improvement to Godot's parallax system.</li>
<li>Project Manager design improvements.</li>
<li>Depth-based fog now possible.</li>
<li>Direct3D 12 support.</li>
<li>A Compositor effects API to let users hook into the built in Godot rendering.</li>
<li>More Wayland improvements on Linux but still opt-in.</li>
<li>2D content renders less blurry in XR.</li>
<li>Slimmer GDScript project exports with Binary tokenization.</li>
<li>+ lots more. Seriously there's loads.</li>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress adds Dwarf Babies, an upgraded Adventure Mode and more but macOS cancelled</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's plenty of good news in the latest Dwarf Fortress update, unless you're a macOS gamer that is. A fresh Beta update is out now.</p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/4237410439220288178" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developers noted you'll no longer be confused whether red-clothed adult dwarves are actually children, since there's now actually baby sprites for dwarves! Oh, the game should also look a fair bit prettier with lots of new fruit, flower and leaf pictures for the "over 180 different plant and tree species". There's also a quest log and information screen for Adventure Mode.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16607664611723727521gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16607664611723727521gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main addition highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quest log and information screen in adventure mode.</li>
<li>Child and baby pictures for dwarves.</li>
<li>Many new fruit, flower, leaf pictures.</li>
<li>Updated dwarf clothing images.</li>
<li>Made good/bad thoughts about tombs work.</li>
<li>Fixed error with experiment portrait mandibles.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're on macOS though, it's been cancelled "for the time being" as it doesn't make enough sense for them to dedicate time to when there's so much of the game still needing work elsewhere. Feels a bit odd to be on the other side of the fence for once, as that's what usually happens to Linux but Dwarf Fortress has Native Linux support already.</p>
<p>They've also said despite the success, they won't be hiring more programmers to speed it up. They're sticking to "Tarn’s vision, no matter how long it takes, rather than trying to optimize for speed" and they see it as a lifetime project, one that will be updated steadily "forever" but slowly. Just like playing the game itself, the development of it is not for the impatient.</p>

      <title>Until Dawn remake arrives on PC October 4, requires PSN account</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those interested in the Until Dawn remake from Ballistic Moon and PlayStation Publishing LLC, it's set to arrive on October 4th.</p>
<p>Much like other recent Sony releases on PC though, it will require a PlayStation Network account. The PlayStation Overlay <em>hasn't</em> been mentioned though which is why Ghost of Tsushima's online mode doesn't work for us, so it <em>should</em> run with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> on Desktop Linux and potentially Steam Deck if you can pull the graphics down enough. I think it's safe to say all Sony PC releases will require a PSN account going forward.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bIkuM5y0Bjw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a3b39373a20fd95ccccde57aca84e69e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bIkuM5y0Bjw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers also shared various details on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/14/until-dawn-rebuilt-and-enhanced-for-ps5-and-pc-launches-october-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation blog</a> about what's new like overhauled visuals with Unreal Engine 5, new camera controls, a reworked prologue, new collectables, more customizable settings and new settings for accessibility and much more.</p>
<p>I always wanted to try it, so I think I'll have to give this one a go.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Mesa 24.2.0 released with a new shader cache implementation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa 24.2.0 is out now bringing with it the usual advancements for open source OpenGL and Vulkan graphics drivers on Linux.</p>
<p>As usual, the Mesa developers suggest that those wanting stability stay with the previous version, or at least wait for Mesa 24.2.1 which is due around August 28th.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main additions are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read on RADV</li>
<li>VK_EXT_legacy_vertex_attributes on lavapipe, ANV, Turnip and RADV</li>
<li>VK_MESA_image_alignment_control on RADV</li>
<li>VK_EXT_shader_replicated_composites on ANV, dozen, hasvk, lavapipe, nvk, RADV, and Turnip</li>
<li>VK_KHR_maintenance5 on v3dv</li>
<li>VK_KHR_maintenance7 on RADV</li>
<li>VK_EXT_depth_clamp_zero_one on v3dv</li>
<li>GL_ARB_depth_clamp on v3d</li>
<li>Defaulting to a new shader cache implementation, reducing filesystem overhead.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Along with a lot of bug fixes too across various drivers including issues solved for Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, Dota 2, Counter-Strike 2, Worms Revolution, Asterix &amp; Obelix XXL: Romastered, Fallout 3, Blender, Starfield, Total War: Warhammer 3, Enshrouded and others.</p>
<p>Plenty of improvements also landed for NVK which should work a fair amount better as of this release.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/24.2.0.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a> for all the details.</p>

      <title>Valve attempts to deal with jokes, memes and ASCII art reviews on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm sure you've all seen some of the more playful user reviews on Steam, but they're not exactly helpful for figuring out if you want to buy a game and so Valve have a new "Helpfulness System" they're testing.</p>
<p>Valve said in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4326355263805583415" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> of the new Beta that this new system will not impact the actual review scores, just change the ordering of what reviews are actually shown. As Valve explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>User reviews that are identified as being unhelpful for potential customers, such as one-word reviews, reviews comprised of ASCII art, or reviews that are primarily playful memes and in-jokes, will be sorted behind other reviews on the game’s store page. That doesn't mean players won't ever see these humorous, but unhelpful posts, but it hopefully means that they’ll see them less frequently when trying to learn about a game. If you enjoy seeing these sorts of reviews when browsing the store, there's an option on the store page to include them when browsing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do Valve determine which to show? They said they use a mixture of techniques, including user reports and the Steam moderation team looking directly at reviews, along with some "machine learning algorithms". They found that a lot of the unhelpful reviews were easy enough to spot but it's all a work in progress. And of course, considering the amount of user reviews on Steam, this could take a while to get through.</p>
<p>For example, looking at Persona 3 Reload without (first picture) and with the new system activated (second picture) and yeah…the results of this new system are pretty clear:</p>

      <title>Two Point Museum announced from the devs of Two Point Hospital / Two Point Campus</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Studios are back with another quirky building and management sim. Following up on the successful releases of Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus the next in the series is Two Point Museum.</p>
<p>Sounds like quite a fun one this. It's not just the usual building and management but with expeditions you get to send your experts on too. There's also a new world-map system to allow you to venture far and wide to undiscovered areas in your quest to find unusual relics in various styles and rarity types to decorate your museum.</p>
<p>As you unearth strange exhibits, the endless star scoring system encourages you to tweak the layout of your museum depending on what you discover. You’ll need to revisit your old collections, showcase your new finds and change your strategy as you push your mega-museum towards becoming Two Point County’s star attraction.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iGmUKTszyRU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/71968abfcc3c8b3a53d66cee7cdc4ef9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iGmUKTszyRU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From what I've seen it will have Native Linux support once again.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist / follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Go capture and breed some Frogs in the Mudborne demo, from the devs of beekeeping sim APICO</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer ellraiser of TNgineers is back again with another wonderful casual exploration, discovery and breeding sim. While <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/its-beeautiful-apico-4-0-brings-automation-machines-to-the-chilled-beekeeping-sim/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">APICO</a> had you do beekeeping, Mudborne has you breed all sorts of Frogs.</p>
<p>Mudborne is a bit more fantasy-styled than APICO with you being able to use the genetic keys of the new species you create you can unlock the paths between the waking and dreaming worlds. Sounds pretty wild.</p>
<p>The game begins with you awakening from hibernation to find your pond abandoned and empty. Through a combination of crafting mini-games, menu management and puzzle solving, experiment with genetics to breed new frogs and recover what was lost.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZHzhR7RGf1U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7048ab16a2122311a87b3cd3629e81e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZHzhR7RGf1U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For this game, the developer has now moved on from Game Maker too, instead going with <a href="https://love2d.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LÖVE</a>, a free and open-source cross-platform framework. Speaking to the developer, ellraiser, it sounds like they're really enjoying their time using LÖVE and of course it works much nicer on Linux too with ellraiser telling me it has "been a breath of fresh air all round".</p>
<p>So you might want to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2355150/Mudborne/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hop over to the Steam page</a> and try out the new demo.</p>

      <title>Valve upgrades Steam Families and Game Recording in the latest Steam Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Steam Beta Client has been released for Desktop and Steam Deck, with a few fixes and upgrades and the change for Steam Families is especially nice.</p>
<p>If you have enabled the specific "Parental Controls" option for a child in your Steam Families available in the Family Management section on Steam, you can now have much easier control over exactly what they can play with an easy right-click menu on games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19816144751723644032gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19816144751723644032gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5956825141723644032gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5956825141723644032gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Great to see Valve continue to make Steam Families much more useful than before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Adults in Steam Families can now right click games in their library and allow/disallow those games for children with parental controls in their family. Also works with multiple games selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Recording</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for disabling game recording on a per-game basis.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash on Steam Client shutdown.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Jump 10 seconds forward/backward buttons could get stuck when viewing a clip or game recording</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced latency of Steam Input API Action Set/Action Set Layer commands. If any input issues are noticed in Steam Input API games please report them in the forums.</li>
<li>Reduced latency of Steam Input API rumble/haptics commands</li>
</ul>
<p>Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a rare bug that could result in the client failing to start due to invalid symlinks in ~/.steam</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Valve confirm plan to get Steam Deck&#39;s SteamOS on the ROG Ally and more handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've known for a long time that Valve planned to get the newer SteamOS that's on the Steam Deck out for more systems, but they've been a bit quiet on it. Now, they've confirmed it's still the plan for the likes of the ROG Ally and other systems.</p>
<p>Just recently I pointed out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steamos-369-beta-for-steam-deck-curiously-mentions-the-asus-rog-ally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">curious mention of the ROG Ally</a> in a recent SteamOS update note. A lot of other sites caught onto this as well, and so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Verge</a> actually got word from Valve on what the update note meant and got a reply from Valve designer Lawrence Yang to mention: "The note about ROG Ally keys is related to third-party device support for SteamOS. The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS." </p>
<p>Additionally Yang noted they're "making steady progress" but it's not ready yet. On top of that Steam Deck OLED drivers for Windows are also being prepared and dual-boot is still planned to come at some point too.</p>
<p>The thing is, you don't need to wait for SteamOS to get Linux on many different handhelds like the ROG Ally, ROG Ally X, Lenovo Legion Go, and various devices from GPD, AYANEO, OneXPlayer because there's multiple versions of Linux out there designed and supported on those devices already like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/chimeraos-46-2-brings-full-asus-rog-ally-x-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/bazzite-linux-36-out-now-bringing-full-asus-rog-ally-x-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>.</p>
<p>Nice to know Valve are still working on it all, but naturally none of it is a priority, since most of their work is to support their own devices with the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED.</p>

      <title>Steam store pages are about to get a lot cleaner, Valve puts an end to game advert spam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a bit of a win for consumers I think, as some developers were making a right mess of their Steam store pages as Valve have now <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4201376568915048836" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> some big changes.</p>
<p>You've probably seen it a good few times: you go to a Steam page, scroll down to get some info on the game, and you're presented with a list of random games from the publisher first that have <em>nothing</em> to do with the game you're wanting to look at. Some publishers really went overboard with this too, essentially publishing a bunch of games to turn them into adverts for other games and it got quite annoying.</p>
<p>In the announcement Valve said new rules will apply to the "About The Game" section, "Short Description" section, "Special Announcement" sections and the "Awards" section that include these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No links to other websites - This means that you cannot use your store page to link to any other website, including social media pages. There are specific link fields provided within your store page editor for linking to common social media platforms or your own website.</li>
<li>No embedded imagery that mimics Steam store UI or buttons - You should not have images or animations that are meant to look like Steam UI such as images that look like wishlist buttons or game capsules or prices.</li>
<li>No images, links, or widgets pointing to other games on Steam - This means that you cannot use your store page description to advertise other products on Steam. If you have related products, you can set up bundles, franchises, or developer homepages.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of this and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/valve-gives-developers-some-big-reasons-to-add-a-demo-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big standalone demo page update</a>, this should also stop all the "free" Prologues that have become much more regular (that are basically demos under a different name) with developers sticking banners on their pages for all their prologues, as now the games and demos can be properly linked together.</p>
<p>On top of that, Valve has adjusted the Steam homepage, to stop all the demos appearing in the New &amp; Trending tab pushing down actual new releases. Instead, there's now a dedicated tab for Trending Free that bundles them all there. A nice change for developers and consumers.</p>

      <title>Ex-Blizzard devs new RTS &#39;Stormgate&#39; out in Early Access, works on Linux but may need a small fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stormgate is a fresh RTS game set in an all-new science fantasy universe, it's hit Early Access today free to play but you may need a little tweak on Linux to run it. Developed by a whole bunch of Ex-Blizzard staffers including people who worked on StarCraft II, Warcraft III as well as C&amp;C: Generals 2 and Wasteland 3, the team certainly knows their stuff.</p>
<p>Quite exciting to see another big RTS enter the market, as someone who absolutely adores these types of games and what I've played of it has been quite promising. Still plenty of rough edges, but that's expected for an unfinished game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lSroUxCsBAQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13b84383fdde036d7f10bde818cda659.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lSroUxCsBAQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The good news is that with Proton 9.0-2, it <em>does</em> work pretty well on Linux (testing done on Kubuntu 24.04). However, there's an issue where you may get <em>stuck</em> on the loading screen when it's checking for Ping. You can overcome this issue with one single terminal command, which as always with suggestions — use at your own risk:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0 1000"</code></p>
<p><em>This allows your user to send and receive ICMP echo packets.</em></p>
<p>After that, no issues getting into the game. Performance is pretty <em>reasonable</em> too, again making allowances since it's not finished. Running it on my AMD Ryzen 5800x and Radeon 6800 XT at 2560x1440 the "Ultra" preset has been giving me a mostly smooth 60FPS+ and largely well over that.</p>
<p>I played a lot of StarCraft and StarCraft II years ago, and playing Stormgate was quite peculiar because it really does feel like StarCraft, although StarCraft with a lower budget. Even some of the unit voice lines sound like an alternate version of some units in StarCraft. This Ex-Blizzard team are certainly doing their best to be StarCraftButNot.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17803597491723576661gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17803597491723576661gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13464492031723576659gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13464492031723576659gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The free to play release does still need you to end up paying eventually though, since it only includes 1v1 ranked matched, 3 player co-op missions (and all heroes in co-op up to level 5) and custom games. If you want all the heroes and the actual campaign, you do <em>need</em> to pay up. For <em>everything</em> it's £50.99 according to Steam in the "Ultimate Early Access Pack".</p>

      <title>Minishoot&#39; Adventures developers rebuilt their UI to get it Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, SoulGame Studio certainly have my attention for their effort on getting Minishoot' Adventures up to Steam Deck Verified. Plus, the game looks really entertaining.</p>
<p>Released back in April 2024, it's a twin-stick bullet hell metroidvania with the adventurous spirit of the first Legend of Zelda. It's gone onto receiving an Overwhelmingly Positive rating from users on Steam so it seems like it's done quite well overall.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iVt4FBVdBJo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8b6bcd3e991d3d1b84716409a33645c7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iVt4FBVdBJo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>After taking a break from the launch, recently the developers released an update to get it Steam Deck Verified that includes these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We rebuilt all UI components that were poorly readable on SteamDeck. Which makes UI more user friendly and accessible for Steam Deck and PC as well.</li>
<li>We did a final pass on optimization to remove nasty lag spikes and FPS drops. Gameplay on PC is more fluid than ever in epic fights which is especially crucial on SteamDeck.</li>
<li>We changed the Steam API to make sure Achievements would work for MacOs user as well. Sorry about that, you should be able to redeem your Achievements if you have a save file around (if not you can find one in the forums about lost save).</li>
</ul>
Smaller changes :
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where unique keys were carried over to new games</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused lag and freeze after reloading the game several times. (Many thanks to xcvdgb and Zookster on discord)</li>
<li>Added the lowest difficulty chosen on the Save slot so you know which Achievement you are eligible to</li>
<li>Made it easier to skip intro (just press Enter or Escape, or Start on gamepad)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More about it in the developers own words: “We designed a map that would be enticing to discover, similar to a Metroidvania, with lots of connections, shortcuts, secrets, and skills that when unlocked, allow to unfold more paths to explore. All the while facing challenging bullet hell style combat with clean and polished visuals. The ability to drive around the world using a mini spaceship as a living character, allows for fluid navigation overall, making the exploration and backtracking a pleasure instead of a chore. We put all our love for Zelda 1 and shoot'em ups into Minishoot', we hope you'll find it interesting!”</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1634860/Minishoot_Adventures/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. Steam Deck Verified and rated Platinum on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1634860" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> so you're good to go on Desktop Linux too with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> version 9.0-2.</p>

      <title>Battle Train could end up being my next favourite deck-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's just something satisfying about laying down tracks, and then slamming a train into your enemy. Battle Train is an interesting spin on deck-builders and there's a demo out now. Tested on Kubuntu Linux with Proton 9.0-2, it worked to perfection.</p>
<p>Here the game is set out like a game-show. You're given a deck a cards that includes train tracks, bombs and all sorts and you just have to get your track built up to the opponents outposts on the board. Then the trains can smash into the outposts destroying them and you win. Easier said than done, with all the different cards you get as you can imagine there's plenty of strategy involved.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zOACIXgZPp8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/954da3bea08688c1cec9952d3bc46643.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zOACIXgZPp8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duel a wide range of foes, each with their own unique cards and abilities.</li>
<li>Customize your train with your favorite power ups.</li>
<li>Build your deck with an array of cards--both functional and fantastical--to obliterate your opponent.</li>
<li>Win riches and prizes through a myriad of special events.</li>
<li>Experience a hilarious story told by the makers of "3 out of 10", Tower of Guns, and Mothergunship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Really fun demo to try and, and really easy to understand and get into. Definitely worth a go.</p>

      <title>Avoid a giant creepy boat stalking you in your kayak in this retro-horror game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those readers who love the recent wave of retro-horror, Delta Kayak could be another good one to check out with a demo now live. Certainly wins points for some originality and total weirdness here.</p>
<p>A mixture of horror and exploration wrapped up in a retro style. Here you were attacked by a strange being, and your pet vanishes without a trace. Your search ends up leading you to discover the twisted origin of the creature and its creator. You must rescue your pet, Pepa, and return home safe and sound.</p>
<p>The game takes place in a real place, the delta of the Paraná River, Argentina. A labyrinth of rivers and streams with lush vegetation and a culture of community with nature.</p>

<p>The demo, lasting between 10 and 15 minutes, shows the beginning of the game, when the character goes out at night in his kayak to run an errand and encounters a half-boat, half-animal creature that constantly stalks him.</p>
<p>Created by Eibriel, who worked in film and television before venturing into video games and uses mainly free and open source tools, such as Godot and Blender. It has Native Linux support and the developer said it will also work on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2632680/Delta_Kayak/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a> and try the demo. The developer plans to launch it before the end of 2024.</p>

      <title>Get a better look at S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl in the Developer Deep Dive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A proper Developer Deep Dive is now available for the delayed S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl and it's looking and sounding really promising.</p>
<p>GSC Game World might actually finally pull me into their world with this one, after I completely bounced off their older games in the series. The release is only a few months away (November 20th) so hopefully the extra time is going to be worth it.</p>
<p>What do we get from this Deep Dive? There's various interviews and behind-the-scenes of the development process, quite a bit of new footage that including the world overview, various locations, gameplay and cut-scenes and there's even a full video walkthrough of one of the story quests.<br/>
<br/>
“We know you might be tired of waiting, and we truly appreciate your patience. These two additional months will give us the chance to fix more “unexpected anomalies” (or simply “bugs”, as you call them). We are always grateful for your ongoing support and understanding - it means the world to us. We’re just as eager as you are to finally release the game and for you to experience it for yourself.” said Yevhen Grygorovych, Game Director at GSC Game World.</p>

      <title>The NoVR mod for Half-Life: Alyx has a big Summer 2024 update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the rumours swirling around a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-working-on-a-new-game-that-could-be-half-life-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Half-Life game coming</a>, this is an excellent time to play the updated NoVR mod for Half-Life: Alyx if you don't own a VR kit. And there's a big Summer 2024 update out now.</p>
<p>Since Half-Life: Alyx was designed for VR, it's still a little odd to try without it, but it's such an important game it deserves to have life outside of VR too.</p>
<p>With this update all the "toner puzzles" are now complete and solvable from start to finish. All Steam Achievements are now obtainable too and there's been a big upgrade to the movement system too so that it should feel smoother and weapons feel better while moving. Plus some other updates:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Map Edits</strong> - players will no longer get caught on objects on the ground like train tracks etc and have proper smooth locomotion through the levels</li>
<li><strong>Viewmodel Changes</strong> - there have been changes to how weapons sway, bob and overall move as you walk and run</li>
<li><strong>Boundary Edits</strong> - players can no longer break level logic and proper edits have been made so players cannot break the map boundaries and other similar issues that could have arised before</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out their update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0f7y7gmUDZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1322d3239c5b1298595f1cdc8f0fdd49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0f7y7gmUDZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More updates are planned for 2024 including support for more mods, new animations, further movement improvements and so on. Perhaps most importantly, they will be getting the Orb Puzzle implementation done too at some point. In case you weren't aware: you can complete the game from start to finish with this mod.</p>
<p>See more in their <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-alyx-novr/news/quakecon-update-summer-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mod DB post</a>. Half-Life: Alyx is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and 66% off until August 19th.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mixing together elements of RimWorld and Terraria, the open world survival crafting game Necesse has a huge graphics overhaul update out now.</p>
<p>Work on this graphics overhaul has been going on for over a year, with the developer pulling in two new artists to make it happen. Another great thing about this update being live now, is that the "artists are no longer playing catch-up with the content updates" so we can expect to see much quicker updates and larger updates in future once again.</p>
<p>Check out the fancy new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Wibgxke29YY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5c4699b6237e3be67758f9edb3deb00e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Wibgxke29YY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a lot to this update outside of much improved graphics, just <em>some</em> of which includes:</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Added 16 new achievements.</li>
<li>Added smooth lighting to rocks and walls.</li>
<li>Added wind effects.</li>
<li>Added the ability to sit on chairs and benches.</li>

<li>Added 8 new beard types you can select during character creation and Stylist change.</li>
<li>Added expression wheel, by default used by holding down T.</li>
<li>Added the ability to restore controls to their default key bind.</li>
<li>Added toggle in pouches to disable auto pickup.</li>
<li>Added Hardhat cosmetic item bought from the Blacksmith.</li>
<li>Added Captains Boots cosmetic item bought from Stylist.</li>
<li>Added Pirate Eyepatch cosmetic item bought from Stylist.</li>
<li>Added Pirate Bandana with Eyepatch cosmetic item bought from Stylist.</li>
<li>Added the option to buy settler cosmetic gear from each settler or Stylist.</li>
<li>Added the Stabby Bush found creeping in the wilds.</li>
<li>Added Landscaping Station crafted at Advanced Workstation.</li>
<li>Added recipes for a ton of different rocks and other objects to the Landscaping Station.</li>
<li>Added the ability to change skin and eyes at the Stylist at the cost of void shards.</li>
<li>Added 2 new boss soundtracks for Sage and Grit and the Cryo Queen.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Remaking 3298 assets has been a great challenge, and the team is super happy with the result. I think anyone who has an affinity for games like Stardew Valley will absolutely adore the new art style of Necesse.” - Bo Michelsen - Artist on Necesse</p>
<p>“From a solo hobby project, to a studio of 8 and now over 1 million people playing my game. It’s been an incredible journey.” - Mads Skovgaard - Creator of Necesse</p>
<p>Necesse has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1169040/Necesse/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy it from Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Sand in a Box is a fresh modern &#39;falling sand&#39; playground out now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Patryk Zieliński of Tiliasoft just released Sand in a Box in Early Access on Steam, a fresh and new falling sand game with a lot of toys to play with.</p>
<p>Sand in a Box is a falling sand simulator with advanced simulation algorithms designed for modern CPUs. Players can experiment with materials like sand, water, metals, lava, and acid, featuring cellular automata physics, thermal imaging, electrical conductivity, and radioactivity. The game supports modding, allowing the creation of new sets of elements and changes to the rules of the simulation. It fully supports Steam Deck (controller and touchscreen) and desktop Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Looks like a whole lot of fun, check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nDTcTKS66pA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b3e443ba105ac71bfde21e7a224df9df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nDTcTKS66pA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking to the developer over email they mentioned how it originally started life as an iOS game on the App Store, but it's been gradually improved over the years with many new features.</p>
<p>Asking them how it differs to games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/classic-free-physics-sandbox-game-the-powder-toy-is-now-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Powder Toy</a>, which also had a Steam release recently, they said "Overall I'm just trying to develop unique features and I don't look at the other 'falling sand' games. I'm not aiming to make a better game than "The Powder Toy", just different enough that people would like to play both of them." and highlighted how it has been "designed for Steam Deck from the start".</p>
<p>Speaking about Early Access they said: "Currently Sand in a Box launches in Early Access and I plan to actively develop it over at least few months listening to community feedback. One of the features I would like to add in a near future is multi-track video editor. That allows to record user input over multiple tracks while processing 'falling sand' simulation.</p>
<p>However the main reason of going Early Access route is community feedback. I personally like to work on cellular automata simulations and there are people who can play with them for hours.<br/>
My ultimate goal is to deliver really good experience for those people, solving multiple programming challenges along the way :)".</p>
<p>One thing to note, is that the developer does use some AI. As noted on the store page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Gameplay trailer on storepage uses song made with the help of suno.ai<br/>
Some backgrounds in the game are made with the help of various generative AI tools like Adobe Firefly.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's available with Native <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2225680/Sand_in_a_Box/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux support on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>I tried the demo of Super reaKtor and it really fried my brain</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Super reaKtor is a unique bullet hell where you absorb various orbs using your laser beam, and while the idea is great it really did annihilate my brain.</p>
<p>The developer, SuperSAZ Studio, just put up a demo on Steam (with Linux support) and this has to be one of the most interesting versions of a bullet hell I've seen for some time. I gave it a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/super-reaktor-is-the-most-insane-looking-bullet-hell-ive-seen-in-a-good-while/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">brief highlight a month ago</a>, curious with how it would actually feel and now I've had the chance to play, I love it — but wow is it surprisingly difficult to get to grips with.</p>
<p>Here you're not only trying to avoid various things flying around a small map, but you're also trying to absorb all the green orbs flying around, using what can only be described as a laser-infused pong paddle. This laser can be spun around in a 360 degree motion, and you can move it all the way around the map while making it bigger and smaller. It's pretty simple mechanically, but the speed of it plus needing to avoid <em>and</em> collect things makes it really quite a challenge to your brain and fingers to not get destroyed.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NELE8h4_Hpo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a24cec1f7f6078378c2a507db05635b2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NELE8h4_Hpo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really clever idea and certainly worth a go. If you love some good tunes and fast retro bullet-hell action, you're probably going to really enjoy it. For arcade high-score chasers, it's a dream.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3077190/Super_reaKtor/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Anodyne 2: Return to Dust from Analgesic Productions source code opened up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Analgesic Productions have opened up the full source code for their 2D-3D action-adventure game Anodyne 2: Return to Dust.</p>
<p>This is a <em>Source Available</em> release, not to be confused with true <em>Open Source</em>, since it's using a custom license with certain restrictions. However, it does effectively make the entire game free (if you build it yourself), since it also includes all the assets. This is the same thing the developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/04/analgesic-productions-have-opened-up-the-source-for-their-zelda-lite-anodyne/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">did with the first Anodyne game</a> and with <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/even-the-ocean-from-analgesic-productions-has-a-source-code-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Even the Ocean</a> as well.</p>
<p>More about it: "In this hybrid 2D-3D action-adventure game, run, jump, and drive across vast, dreamy 3D landscapes. Shrink into surreal, 2D dungeons inside of characters' bodies. Travel the world, meet strange people, and save the world from the dangerous Nano Dust. Don't miss the follow-up to the classic game 'Anodyne'!"</p>
<p>You can see their video on the source release below and check out their <a href="https://melodicambient.substack.com/p/anodyne-2-goes-open-source" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>:</p>

<p>Another great way for game developers to learn from a full and complete game. It's great to see!</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/analgesicproductions/Anodyne-2-Open-Source" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source code on GitHub</a>. It also uses Unity, so you'll need that to work with it.</p>

      <title>Minetest 5.9.0 brings performance improvements, a godrays shader and work towards SDL2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest release of Minetest with version 5.9.0 is out now, bringing new features and work towards using SDL2 for this free and open source voxel game engine.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main <a href="https://dev.minetest.net/Changelog#5.8.0_.E2.86.92_5.9.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highlights</a> of this release includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rendering performance improvements (<em>paradust7</em>, <em>sfan5</em> &amp; <em>x2048</em>).</li>
<li>Added godrays shader (<em>x2048</em>).</li>
<li>New multithreaded Lua mapgen API to improve performance of custom mapgens. (<em>sfan5</em>).</li>
<li>Android: Punch with short tap (<em>grorp</em>).</li>
<li>Work in the background on switching to SDL2 for windowing and input (but not enabled in this release).</li>
</ul>

<p>While the SDL2 switch is not yet finished, it's going to be a real nice change for Minetest and all the games using it. Since this will give better support for windowing and input. So you'll get proper touch-screen, gamepads and much more like easy full-screen switching too.</p>

      <title>Tango Gameworks (Hi-Fi RUSH) lives again with KRAFTON</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At last, the good kind of industry news, and something worth celebrating. KRAFTON, the publisher of games like PUBG has acquired Tango Gameworks along with the Hi-Fi RUSH IP. Tango Gameworks developed The Evil Within 1 &amp; 2, Ghostwire: Tokyo, Hero Dice and Hi-Fi Rush.</p>
<p>The developer will no longer be shut down thanks to this! As confirmed in a <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-strengthens-global-presence-through-strategic-integration-of-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>, KRAFTON will be working with Xbox and ZeniMax "to ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the Hi-Fi RUSH IP and explore future projects" which sounds great. They also said there will be "no impact on the existing game catalog of The Evil Within, The Evil Within 2, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and the original Hi-Fi RUSH game".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11808532131723462657gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Considering how popular Hi-Fi RUSH is with some excellent reviews (it really is great), this is just wonderful to see.</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS 46-2 brings full ASUS ROG Ally X support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another update for the handheld and couch gaming Linux distribution ChimeraOS, with version 46-2 out now bringing full ROG Ally X support. Easily one of the best choices to get Linux on your handheld!</p>
<p>This release comes with Linux kernel v6.9.12, Mesa graphics drivers v24.1.5, Gamescope Plus v3.14.24, OpenGamepadUI v0.33.3-1 and InputPlumber v0.34.4-1. Really though the headline feature is full support for the ASUS ROG Ally X, and various improvements around input for multiple different devices!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20041169191723461532gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Here's the full list of <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/Release-Notes#chimeraos-46-2-2024-08-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added full support for the ROG Ally X.</li>
<li>Improved power saving while suspended for the ROG Ally and ROG Ally X.</li>
<li>Experimental support for emulating the Steam Deck controller has been added to InputPlumber and OpenGamepadUI. There is a known issue that suspending the system while using the emulated Steam Deck controller will cause the system to freeze. Users are encouraged to try this mode and report any additional bugs they find so it can be further improved. You can switch to the new mode using the OpenGampadUI gamepad settings in the Quick Bar.</li>
<li>Touch-pads on the Lenovo Legion Go, OrangePi Neo, and the Steam Deck will now automatically map to a touch-pad device on the selected target device when using the steam-plus or full OpenGamepadUI sessions. Emulated Xbox target devices will spawn a virtual touch-pad and the emulated DS5 and Steam Deck controllers will use their native touch-pads.</li>
<li>Added support for some Xbox Series controllers in Bluetooth mode to InputPlumber. Additional Xbox Bluetooth controllers are planned for the next release.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug in InputPlumber returning from suspend where the back paddles on the ROG Ally and ROG Ally X would no longer function.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug in InputPlumber that could, in some rare cases, cause controls to become unresponsive after a rumble event.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug that caused new installations to fail on devices with the MT7922 WiFi card, such as the Lenovo Legion Go and ROG Ally devices.</li>
<li>Added kernel patch to fix HDMI audio on AMD</li>
<li>Added AyaNeo 2S screen rotation quirk to the kernel.</li>
<li>Mesa fixes from 24.1 series</li>
</ul>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher v2.15 has expanded GOG support, EA games from Epic Store support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big release for the Heroic Games Launcher team has landed, version 2.15.0 is out now with some necessary bug fixes and some big new features to help you get all your games on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. Four months on from the last release, this has been in the makings for a while!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3652159831723460711gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3652159831723460711gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for EA games from Epic Games Store</li>
<li>Fixed issues with downloading from Amazon Games</li>
<li>Added (legacy) DRM support for Amazon Games - Devil May Cry 1 is now playable</li>
<li>Discord rich presence overhaul</li>
<li>[Linux] Experimental <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher" rel="noopener" target="_blank">umu-launcher</a> support (disabled by default until 1.x release)</li>
<li>[Linux] Experimental <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/comet" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comet</a> support - enabling GOG achievements and multiplayer</li>
<li>[Linux] It is now possible to install and uninstall DLC for Native Linux games.</li>
<li>[macOS] GPTK (Gaming Port Toolkit) is now available to download from Wine Manager (Works better with Apple Silicon and with macOS Sonoma or higher).</li>
<li>Several other improvements and fixes all around Heroic</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again doing what companies don't, the GOG improvement with Comet is a big one, especially for Linux since it brings us closer to the features available via GOG Galaxy. Once umu is properly ready, that will be another great one so we can get the best possible compatibility when running games via Proton in Heroic so I'm looking forward to seeing that progress.</p>
<p>A quick follow-up release v.2.15.1 was also made to solve some issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[FIX] Sideloads with proton without umu by <a href="https://github.com/Etaash-mathamsetty" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@Etaash-mathamsetty</a> in <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/pull/3936" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#3936</a></li>
<li>[Fix] Make <code class="inline-code">GamesDBDataInner</code>'s <code class="inline-code">square_icon</code> optional by <a href="https://github.com/CommandMC" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@CommandMC</a> in <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/pull/3933" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#3933</a></li>

      <title>The Elder Scrolls: Arena re-implementation OpenTESArena gets a graphics code overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like this project is coming along nicely, and I do very much love seeing classics get revived with open source game engine re-implementations. OpenTESArena for The Elder Scrolls: Arena has a new release out.</p>
<p>It's still considered "pre-alpha" with proper gameplay to come later, but worth keeping an eye on, because projects like this can end up doing some amazing things (just look at OpenMW for Morrowind!). This is the first release since 2021!</p>
<p>Speaking about the OpenTESArena 0.15.0 release the developer said: "This release overhauls the graphics code to more closely match the look of the original game. The renderer now also uses meshes, shaders, and draw calls normally found in an OpenGL or Vulkan engine.</p>
<p>Overall FPS is below average due to draw calls not being batched yet and the rasterizer being relatively unoptimized (it was very challenging to reliably coax all compilers to output good assembly, so there is still room for improvement). One optimization of interest however is the addition of a voxel quadtree for efficiently testing visibility to the camera."</p>
<p>Check out their showcase video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LEjsv2AehOg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9cc4c86c2cbfcd13a943c04c88a81195.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LEjsv2AehOg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New features in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New 3D software renderer:
<ul>
<li>Closely matches original game's 256 color lighting (special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Carmina16" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@Carmina16</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved Arena data files detection (now checks default C: Steam install on Windows).</li>
<li>Added exclusive fullscreen option.</li>
<li>Added tall pixel correction option.</li>
<li>Initial work on player attributes (@gazorpo).</li>
<li>Improved screenshot saving.</li>
<li>Minor change to player movement to match original game.</li>
<li>ARM64 macOS support.</li>
<li>Replaced debug collision option with ghost mode that allows flying.</li>
<li>Replaced DebugFast build config with ReleaseGenericNoLTO.</li>
<li>Removed time scale option.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Try the demo for The Protagonish, an adventure game where you don&#39;t control the adventurer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is a bit more on the unique side isn't it? I know we have plenty of classic adventure game fans in the GOL readership, but what about one where you don't actual control the adventurer? Check out The Protagonish.</p>
<p>It has all the usual marks of a classic point and click adventure game, but you're not the main character. Instead, you jump between the villagers, and choose to guide or distract the adventurer from their quest, with puzzles, comedy dialogue choices, and mysteries to uncover. Absolutely love the idea!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MFu972ETz9k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e96b854de5311227f7d71549078691d9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MFu972ETz9k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With full voice acting and plenty of colourful characters, backed up by some lovely hand-drawn animations, this is one you should check out.</p>
<p>More: "Explore the beautifully hand-drawn village, and discover the lives and plans of four varied characters in this short game with multiple endings. Through your dialogue choices, be a shopkeeper out for the best deal, a monk who's taken a vow of silence, or a miner who's had a bump on the head and not quite saying what he means. And finally there is the mysterious beastie..."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2994780/The_Protagonish/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">try the demo on Steam</a> right now. It will be available with Native Linux support at release.</p>

      <title>Preserve is a wonderfully chilled and beautiful relaxing nature-building game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love tile-based chilled puzzle games like Dorfromantik, you'll probably really love Preserve. This one is all about repopulating a wasteland to create a vibrant and flourishing ecosystem. <em>Note: key via the developer.</em></p>
<p>Just released into Early Access, it's available now with Native Linux support and from my testing it really does work great. One of the most chilled and relaxing games I've played recently, with a peaceful atmosphere that allows you to almost zone-out with it and as you're placing down all types of tiles to bring the world to life. It doesn't get much calmer than this while playing games.</p>
<p>Very similar in style to the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/relaxing-and-gorgeous-city-builder-dorfromantik-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dorfromantik</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/tiny-atolls-is-a-comfy-and-relaxing-minimalist-city-builder/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tiny Atolls</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/06/colourful-city-builder-islanders-has-officially-released-for-linux-and-its-really-lovely/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ISLANDERS</a> where you start with nothing and gradually build up a score of points based on what tiles you put down, and building up a combination score from having multiple of the same together. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gWKFzR1oO5U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ecc3dc533df7046f541c5ee74cb0a77.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gWKFzR1oO5U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I especially love the way you expand the world. Instead of you revealing more as you go, you build up points to purchase a new land expansion, which you place around the existing land in a place and position of your choosing, allowing you to really get it how you want it. </p>
<p>That, and the vertical system. Here it's not just placing down tiles, you're gradually building upwards as well with tiles on top of tiles. Eventually, you end up with a ridiculously vibrant world full of different colours and habitats for flora and fauna.</p>
<p>While it is a puzzle game, it's much more on the chilled side, the points system is reasonably easy to keep going with it, so you don't particularly need to worry about it much at all. Although, if you're aiming for a real high score, it will stop and make you think on your tile placements a lot more. So it has a nice balance of ease and challenge overall.</p>
<p>In Early Access the developers plan to continue building it up over the next year to include more biomes (there's three currently) with unique ecosystems, flora, fauna and so on. They also want to add in more puzzles and challenges to deepen the gameplay overall which sounds great. They have a truly wonderful start here, I can't wait to see more from it.</p>

      <title>TUXEDO reveal the InfinityFlex a fully foldable Linux laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TUXEDO are flexing their hardware chops here with the InfinityFlex, a fully foldable Linux laptop so you can use it wherever and however you want. <em>No that's not drool on my top, honest.</em></p>
<p>With the ability to fold the screen right down on top of the unit, you can use it as a standard laptop or more like a tablet. Since it has a pressure-sensitive touch display, pairing it up with a pen you can use it for all sorts of artwork projects too. Pretty light as well at only 1.5KG.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12097365151723202057gol1.png"/></p>
<p>TUXEDO put some fun work into this one by the sounds of it. They said "soon as the device is used in monitor or tablet mode, the keyboard and touchpad are automatically deactivated to prevent incorrect entries, the screen content is rotated according to the chassis orientation and TUXEDO OS also adapts its UI to touch operation".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>14-inch IPS Touch Display, 1920 x 1200, sRGB color gamut: 100 %, Brightness: 400 nits.</li>
<li>Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX211, Bluetooth 5.3.</li>
<li>55 Wh battery.</li>
<li>Intel Core i5-1335U, Intel Iris Xe Graphics.</li>
<li>DDR4-3200 MHz SO-DIMM, 16GB on the base model.</li>
<li>500 GB Samsung 980 (NVMe PCIe 3.0).</li>
</ul>
<p>Looks and sounds like a real nice machine.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-InfinityFlex-14-Gen1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TUXEDO store</a>. Available for pre-order with shipping after September 16th.

      <title>Decky Loader plugins should no longer cause bootloops on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Decky Loader developers have announced that their plugin system for Steam Deck should no longer cause bootloops with the latest pre-release build.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/certain-steam-deck-plugins-via-decky-loader-are-causing-bootloops/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">News I covered just recently</a>, users discovered a number of plugins that would cause the Steam Deck to get stuck where the Big Picture Mode just wouldn't appear. Thankfully you could fix it with some manual effort, but that should no longer be needed.</p>
<p>As of "<a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/releases/tag/v3.0.0-pre8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prerelease v3.0.0-pre8</a>", the developers noted it fixes a "race condition causing crash loops". Additionally, posting in their Discord server, developer "Train" <a href="https://discord.com/channels/960281551428522045/960459928538087424/1271209426803626015" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're also taking steps to ensure future issues do not cause breakage to this degree and to notify users of when plugins are delisted or issues with Decky Loader are discovered by us or made known to us by users. Thanks everyone for being patient and contributing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also mentioned in a GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/certain-steam-deck-plugins-via-decky-loader-are-causing-bootloops/comment_id=267073" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><small>[…]</small> To those wondering, we're currently working on an MOTD feature to allow us to better notify users of issues with plugins and we're working on delisting broken plugins.<br/>
As of the most recent pre-release of Decky, v3.0.0-pre7, we now have a screen and logic that catches these loops and stops decky and should allow you to find and remove any of the effected plugins. We also have future plans to ensure plugins are easier to report as broken but we don't have anything concrete in that regard yet. Have a lovely week everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the developer who fixed the issue "AAGaming" also mentioned in a GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/certain-steam-deck-plugins-via-decky-loader-are-causing-bootloops/comment_id=267110" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've fixed this in the latest prerelease (v3.0.0-pre8), broken plugins shouldn't be able to cause bootloops anymore. It was caused by an extremely hard to find race condition in a new feature of @decky/ui (previously decky-frontend-lib)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So thankfully, you should be pretty safe to use the latest pre-release version again with various plugins on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The Decky Loader team certainly have their work cut out for them, given that all of this is community-made with no direct support for plugins from Valve. Hopefully in future Valve might consider some sort of API to help make their job easier.</p>

      <title>Blackjack roguelike adventure Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to break Blackjack? Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers has you battle your way through a seedy tavern filled with gambling addicted townspeople in this Blackjack roguelike adventure.</p>
<p>More about it: Begin your adventure in a tavern that is home to a unique, corrupted version of blackjack you have never played before. You will need to pick up the rules and adapt to them as you progress through the tavern, challenging a colourful cast of blackjack-addicted townspeople. Discover the mystery of who runs this twisted casino as you progress through the tavern to take them down.</p>
<p>Complete with over 300 cards, you won’t just be drawing from a traditional deck to take down greedy opponents. Teeming with a wacky assortment of cards ranging from birthday cards to tarot cards, there’s plenty of unique combinations you can use to outwit their fiendish foes and emerge victorious in this stakes roguelike.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zo86D4qDV2c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/694578d8ac25db346762fa79f8b96d4d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zo86D4qDV2c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their PR team didn't reply to my code request on this one, so I've not personally had a proper chance to play with it yet. Looks great though, probably a good one for fans of Balatro.</p>

<p>While we have various source port projects like the fantastic GZDoom, the newer KEX engine versions will at least make them play a lot nicer on modern systems completely out of the box. There's definitely something to be said for convenience.</p>

<li>BOOM source compatibility makes it possible for hundreds of community-created mods from the past 25 years to be published in-game.</li>
<li>Accessibility options, such as a modern font to improve legibility, high contrast mode, text-to-speech, speech-to-text multiplayer chat and more.</li>
<li>Translated into 8 new languages: Mexican Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese.</li>

<p>On top of that, a brand new episode was also released named Legacy of Rust. This was made in collaboration by id Software, Nightdive Studios, and MachineGames. Legacy of Rust is the newest episode for DOOM, and the first official episode since DOOM II to feature new demons and weapons. This 16-map Episode is broken up into two 8 map sections: The Vulcan Abyss and Counterfeit Eden.</p>
<p>The online features do need a Bethesda account, just to be clear. Plus, the original DOS versions of DOOM (1993) and DOOM II are still included so it's not like they've just been wiped away, which is good to see for proper preservation. So no need to complain about the classics not needing to be touched, they're still there.</p>

      <title>Sober is a new way to play Roblox on Linux from the Vinegar team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Roblox does still remain blocked on Linux with Wine, as usual the community finds a way. The Vinegar team recently revealed Sober, a currently closed-source specialized runtime for the Android version of Roblox.</p>
<p>So if you're really desperate to get Roblox on Linux, Sober seems like the main way right now. Since it uses the Android version, you do need to <em>manually</em> download a Roblox APK which can be done from various mirror websites like <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/roblox-corporation/roblox/roblox-2-636-626-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">apkmirror</a>. There's lots of these sites where you can grab an APK, do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>The Vinegar team explain: "Sober crafts a specialized runtime for the Android version of Roblox. Effectively, it bridges the small gap between Android and Linux, allowing for a native unofficial port."</p>
<p>As you can see from my shot below, it works:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1118126851723133013gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1118126851723133013gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently it's available to download as Flatpak, but not from Flathub as they're hosting it themselves.</p>
<p>Like before when playing Roblox in Wine though, it's possible (and probable) it will be blocked eventually. Although, it may end up being a little more difficult with something like this. </p>

      <title>System76 desktop environment COSMIC alpha now available to try</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 have today released the first alpha preview for you to try out COSMIC, their brand new home-grown desktop environment. Built with Rust, it should hopefully feel pretty familiar to most Linux users with a visual style that matches up to their current GNOME-based desktop.</p>
<p>While they're building it for their own Pop!_OS, with a alpha iso for Pop, it's designed to be cross-distro and they even have ways for you to test it out directly on a few other distributions already.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21289625901723132053gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21289625901723132053gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - COSMIC Alpha 1 using automatic tiling for opened windows</em></p>
<p>Their vision for COSMIC: "COSMIC began as our answer to user feedback we’ve received on improving Pop!_OS. The new desktop environment introduces a custom theming system, streamlined Auto-tiling, new core applications including an app store, and provides you more control over your workflow. Written in the Rust programming language, COSMIC is more stable, more secure, and better optimized for performance."</p>
<p>Keep in mind this is the first alpha build, there will likely be many bugs and unfinished features. Going by the press details they sent this is what's currently complete:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Settings pages + applets for daily use for most users
<ul>
<li>Applets provide many settings needs
<ul>
<li>Connecting to bluetooth and wireless networks. Choosing audio input and output devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Highlight COSMIC’s unique features
<ul>
<li>Panel and Dock Customization</li>
<li>Appearance and Themes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OS Interfaces
<ul>
<li>Panels, Launcher, App Library, Greeter, Dialogs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apps
<ul>
<li>Settings, Files, Text Editor, Store, Terminal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compositor features
<ul>
<li>Auto-Tiling, Snapping (Manual-Tiling), Stacking, and Sticky Windows</li>
<li>Excellent nvidia hybrid graphics support</li>
<li>Fractional scaling</li>
<li>Wayland native with XWayland support</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is what's still to be done:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Numerous Settings pages</li>
<li>Frosted effect for OS interfaces</li>
<li>Variable refresh rate</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Initial Setup
<ul>
<li>Need to set time manually</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Workspaces features, animations, and refinement</li>
<li>Lots of COSMIC Files work</li>
<li>Bug fixes and refinement</li>
<li>Compositor software rendering
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing in VMs requires hardware acceleration</strong></li>
<li>GNOME Boxes uses software acceleration but it’s pretty smooth</li>
<li>VirtualBox requires enabling VT-x/AMD-V and Enable Nested Paging</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://system76.com/cosmic" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the official website</a>.</p>
<p>A promising start to what could be a really interesting Linux desktop environment, although as expected it is on the rough side being in alpha right now you can clearly see where they're going with it. I can imagine this becoming <em>really</em> popular.</p>
<p>When you've tried it be sure to let me know your thoughts in the comments.</p>

      <title>Steel &amp; Blood is a huge upgrade for horde battler Rogue: Genesia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue: Genesia is easily one of the best survivor-like horde games, and it just got even better with the huge Steel &amp; Blood update.</p>
<p>More about it: Walk upon a new world and slay foes endangering it. Rogue : Genesia is an action rogue-lite game, where you fight relentless hordes consisting of hundreds and thousands of monsters, make your build, break the balance, defeat bosses and save one of the many worlds.</p>
<p>The new Steel &amp; Blood update has added in a highly customizable equipment system. Once you've played it for a bit you'll unlock access to it, allowing you to equip various different items much like a traditional RPG. All items you find have their own level and tier, allowing you to keep upgrading and swapping. Items have various modifiers, and you can recycle items to learn them, to allow you to then craft the modifier onto another item. Sounds like a lot of fun for mixing up your runs. There's a lot more like a new world, a new avatar to play as, a new zone variant, various performance improvements and the list goes on and on.</p>

      <title>Balatro hits 2 million sales and a major free gameplay update is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the most popular recent releases on Steam that's Steam Deck Verified (and works great on desktop Linux), Balatro has done really well.</p>
<p>More about it: The poker roguelike. Balatro is a hypnotically satisfying deckbuilder where you play illegal poker hands, discover game-changing jokers, and trigger adrenaline-pumping, outrageous combos.</p>
<p>Especially great, considering it's from a solo developer, to hit 2 million sales in a few months is absolutely amazing. Well deserved too, it is a wonderful game. The developer seems really nice too, <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1820752209765961746" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioning</a> recently on X (Twitter) that they've ensured it can't be turned into an actual gambling game:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21224054611723109103gol1.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the outside this might make 0 sense but I hate the thought of Balatro becoming a true gambling game so much that when I recently created my will I stipulated that the Balatro IP may never be sold or licensed to any gambling company/Casino</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for what's to come next? Teased in a post on Steam is the next major update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6204970791723109215gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The first major announcement in this campaign is that there will be a major gameplay update coming to Balatro in 2025. This update will bring new ideas and strategies to the game and will be released across all platforms. And as a token of huge appreciation to the game’s brilliant and passionate community, the update will be completely free.</p>

      <title>Prehistoric farming life sim Roots of Pacha 1.2 is out now, plus a &#39;massive&#39; update on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roots of Pacha from Soda Den has a fresh free update out now in version 1.2, and they're not slowing down with more big free updates planned.</p>
<p>More about it: Be a part of a thriving stone age community. Discover "ideas", domesticate crops, befriend animals, and contribute to the growth of your village. Play with friends in co-op or explore the early days of civilization in single-player.</p>
<p>The 1.2 update brings a huge upgrade to how children work in the game with them now going to school, they will hang out together, develop personalities, discover what future professions they wish to do and more. Children's different combinations of parents, personality quirks, and prospective professions help unearth earnable gifts and distinct dialog.</p>
<p>You also get new skin tones and hair colours to establish more unique villager identities. Invent unknown technologies from new Ideas to provide time-saving tools like the olla watering pot. Tame mammoths, spiders, cave lions, wolves, and more as new mount options — play fetch with them and obtain valuable resources like herbs and meat.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, what's next? Soda Den are promising a "massive update underway with two new regions, fishing in canoes/rafts, camping, ball sport, iron, volcano caves, and more" which sounds really exciting. Although it's not due until next year.</p>
<p>Roots of Pacha has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.6.9 Beta for Steam Deck curiously mentions the ASUS ROG Ally</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a pretty important set of bug fixes for the Steam Deck with the new SteamOS 3.6.9 Beta, plus an interesting mention of the ASUS ROG Ally that could point to things to come.</p>
<p>Their release notes mention how they "Added support for extra ROG Ally keys", which could potentially (finally!) point towards a SteamOS release for more devices. However, to temper some expectations here, it's probably more likely it's just Steam Input changes rolled into the SteamOS Beta update before they arrive in the main Steam Client Beta for all platforms (which hasn't seen an update yet).

      <title>Second Dinner (MARVEL SNAP) now investing in W4 Games for Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Clearly, <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> is going places, with more and more games using this cross-platform free and open source game engine that doesn't require royalty payments and now they've pulled in Second Dinner who developed MARVEL SNAP.</p>
<p>Announced via a press release it notes that <a href="https://www.w4games.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">W4 Games</a>, the company set up by Godot Engine contributors, and Second Dinner have entered into a "multi-year strategic partnership" with Second Dinner planning "to build the most ambitious Godot game yet" and so Second Dinner has joined W4 Games as a strategic investor.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“When we formed W4 Games a couple of years ago, our vision was to make Godot the game engine of choice for superstar game developers. We are thrilled to announce this collaboration since Second Dinner represents exactly our vision” shares Nicola Farronato, W4 Games Co-CEO.<br/>
<br/>
“Second Dinner has always been an inspiration for me, a company that is never afraid to break new grounds in all senses. It will be a huge pleasure to work with them ensuring the success of their future titles” adds Juan Linietsky, Godot Engine creator and W4 Games Co-CEO.<br/>

      <title>Valve working on a new game that could be Half-Life 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Take this with your usual scepticism, but it appears Valve are working on another new game (no not Deadlock that leaked previously) which may end up being Half-Life 3.</p>
<p>News comes thanks to a post on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ek3943/valve_is_working_on_a_title_under_the_codename/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, that links to a certain actress's official website that notes they're doing Voice Over for "Project White Sands (video game)" from Valve on their résumé. Their website was later updated to remove the mention, but I've confirmed via the Internet Archive it was previously listed.</p>
<p>While it's not proof and it doesn't necessarily mean anything will actually release (Valve cancelled various games before release previously), clearly Valve are doing <em>something</em> interesting here at the moment. White Sands is the giveaway, since it's a U.S National Park based in New Mexico which is where the Black Mesa Research Facility is located. So uh, that's a pretty strong hint right? However, the name could also be a red herring to intentionally throw anyone off from potential leaks too.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting at this point that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Half-Life: Alyx</a> is currently 66% off until August 19th. It's been as low as that a couple of times before but it <em>is</em> still the lowest Valve has ever put it so far. Might be a good time to check it out if you haven't already, perhaps with the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-alyx-novr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Half-Life Alyx NoVR mod</a> if you don't have a VR headset. I won't spoil it, but it's an <em>important</em> game.</p>
<p>Data miner Tyler McVicker also covered it in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36gF6eiCsqU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">video</a> going over some details.</p>

      <title>Certain Steam Deck plugins via Decky Loader are causing bootloops</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Update: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/decky-loader-plugins-should-no-longer-cause-bootloops-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Now fixed</a>!</p>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Uh oh. Not only did we recently have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/the-jackbox-megapicker-fixed-to-stop-megabreaking-your-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the issue with The Jackbox Megapicker</a> breaking the Steam Deck, but now plugins via Decky Loader too.</p>
<p>The main issue here is with the upcoming 3.x.x release series, which has been in development for a while now. The issue shouldn't be present with the current stable 2.x.x series.</p>
<p>Writing in an announcement on the Decky Loader Discord, developer "Train" <a href="https://discord.com/channels/960281551428522045/960459928538087424/1270616253991747616" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Music Control plugin is delisted and should be uninstalled as it causes Steam BPM to "bootloop" in newer versions of Decky Loader such as the current pre-releases of 3.X.X. We also have users experiencing the same issue without that plugin installed so I would recommend manually deleting one plugin at a time to see which plugin is [affecting] you. You will need to delete any [affected] plugin(s) from <code class="inline-code">~/homebrew/plugins/</code> (You will need to use sudo to delete the files, suggest using konsole and using <code class="inline-code">sudo rm -r /path/to/plugin</code>). Pressing Ctrl+Alt+Semicolon on a USB keyboard connected to your deck while the deck is booting up and before it crashes, should get you to the Desktop and allow you to bypass the "bootloops" and delete the plugin. A pre-connected Bluetooth keyboard should also do the trick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One user in the Decky Loader Discord has been <a href="https://discord.com/channels/960281551428522045/960284126701813770/1270711371301912596" rel="noopener" target="_blank">collecting</a> the names of various plugins that cause the bootloop issue and those that are okay (credit to user "IᖇIS ᑎᕮᗷᑌᒪᗩ"). This list keeps changing, but this is what they noted at time of posting the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following plugins break Decky Loader 3.x.x pre-release <u>(unbootable Deck):</u></p>
<ul>
<li>DeckRoulette 1.1.3-0950f29</li>
<li>GameView Music 1.1.0-1</li>
<li>MicroSDeck 0.9.1-1 <em>(see list below)</em></li>
<li>MusicControl 1.1.5 <em>(see list below)</em></li>
<li>Network Info 1.0.1-13b914b</li>
<li>Remote Play Whatever 1.0.0</li>
<li>System Toolbox 1.0.2-1</li>
</ul>
<p>The following plugins DO NOT break Decky Loader 3.x.x pre-release:</p>
<ul>
<li>MetaDeck 2.0.2-4a7335d</li>
<li>MicroSDeck 0.10.3</li>
<li>MusicControl 1.1.6-a93c611</li>
<li>Save Manager 0.0.1-0ef2a15</li>
<li>Syncthing 0.2.1-389a842</li>
<li>EmuDecky 1.0.7</li>
</ul>
<p>The following plugins DO NOT break Decky Loader 3.x.x pre-release, but are themselves broken on it, while they were working fine on 2.12.3:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Controller Tools 1.2.2</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So you might want to go and check what you're using with Decky Loader, before any plugins may cause you some issues. Decky Loader is a community project, not supported by Valve, so you're generally on your own for issues it causes and will have to fix any problems yourself. As much as I like the idea of Decky Loader, it does seem to cause a fair few problems.</p>

      <title>DRL (Doom, the Roguelike) is coming to Steam as Jupiter Hell Classic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jupiter Hell Classic is the demake of a remake of a roguelike unmake of a famous 1993 FPS shooter. Rip and Tear!</p>
<p>Confused yet? You should be. Developer ChaosForge made DRL, which was originally called DoomRL until they had a legal issue. A fast and furious coffee-break roguelike game, that is heavily inspired by the popular FPS game Doom. Later, they made their own proper IP with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/fantastic-roguelike-jupiter-hell-gets-a-new-scary-boss-new-locations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jupiter Hell</a>, one of my all-time favourite roguelikes for it's awesome movement system as well as the fun action.</p>
<p>Now, they're <em>returning</em> to DRL, turning it into Jupiter Hell Classic. They said they're "updating the game's mechanics and graphics and changing the setting to match the one featured in its acclaimed remake - Jupiter Hell - and bringing the game to Steam players, as a fully-featured commercial release".</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic, unforgiving, top-down, grid-based roguelike gameplay.</li>
<li>2D tile-based graphics.</li>
<li>Diagonal movement.</li>
<li>Steam Workshop support for all your nostalgia modding needs!</li>

<p>Follow it along <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126530/Jupiter_Hell_Classic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on the Steam page</a>. Releasing later this year with Linux support.</p>

      <title>World of Goo 2 is out now with Native Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the original greats from the original indie games boom has returned, World of Goo 2 from 2DBOY and Tomorrow Corporation is now available.</p>
<p>While it's exclusive to the Epic Store when it comes to launchers, you can also buy it with Native Linux support DRM-free directly from their website. So no launcher at all is needed for it.</p>
<p>As for why it's an Epic Exclusive they said this: "World of Goo 2 would not exist if Epic had not helped us fund the game! We were able to hire artists and engineers for multiple years to help us build the biggest game we've ever made. We're grateful for this! You've likely seen similar arrangements with other games, and I imagine ours is comparable."</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer:</p>

<p>Will you be upgrading? Those seems like some nicely competitive prices. Seems like my Ryzen 5800x is finally starting to see its age, although it still runs everything nicely, those above sure do look tempting.</p>

      <title>Next Heroic Games Launcher release to include initial GOG Galaxy support</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Everyone's favourite Linux games launcher has added yet another milestone feature thanks to Linguin and other Heroic contributors. The <em>development</em> version of Heroic now uses a project named <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/comet" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comet</a> to translate a game's GOG Galaxy API calls using a platform-agnostic SDK.</p>
<p>What this means is that now you can play GOG games that previously required the (non-Linux native) GOG Galaxy client!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/565032711722967971gol1142.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/565032711722967971gol1142.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Synthetik: Legion Rising without (left) and with (right) comet running.</em></p>
<p>This feature has now been merged into the main git branch and will be included in the <em>next</em> release. If you have a burning desire to try this feature now, you can either build the git Heroic version, or run comet manually, which I will describe below.</p>
<p>To run comet standalone, first head to the <a href="http://github.com/imLinguin/comet/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">project page</a> or <a href="http://github.com/imLinguin/comet/releases/tag/v0.1.2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">download the 0.1.2 release</a>. Next <a href="http://github.com/imLinguin/comet/releases/download/v0.1.2/dummy-service.zip" rel="noopener" target="_blank">download</a> and unpack the dummy GOG service and run<br/>
<code class="inline-code">install-dummy-service.bat</code> in the GOG game's wine prefix. You can do this using heroic by going to game settings, selecting "Run EXE on Prefix," then selecting the <code class="inline-code">.bat</code> file from the directory you downloaded. Finally, make sure that you are logged into your GOG account in your heroic client, and run <code class="inline-code">comet --from-heroic --username</code> (your GOG user name) from a terminal. Note that you can do the same using Lutris by changing <code class="inline-code">--from-heroic</code> to <code class="inline-code">--from-lutris</code>. This will launch the comet daemon using your GOG credentials from the Heroic launcher. If you have any problems you can post here or head over to the <a href="https://discord.gg/JWV9FSYY5w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic discord</a> for support.</p>
<p>And you're done! Fire up the GOG game of your choice and revel in the multiplayer madness! Another banger addition by the Heroic team.</p>

      <title>Extreme sports game Descenders Next announced for 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from the success of the downhill extreme sports game Descenders, developer RageSquid and publisher No More Robots have announced the much bigger Descenders Next is coming.</p>
<p>They said that while the original focused on mountain biking, and did a pretty good job of it (I certainly enjoyed the challenge), this time they're aiming much higher. Their goal, they said, is to "create the only extreme sports game that anyone will ever need, ever again". When it releases sometime in 2025 it will come with "as many extreme sports as we can" that currently includes the addition of boarding sports and as long as players keep coming back they plan to keep adding more to it.</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1CaveESUCdA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9672431c6ce6ad1b24f0971390183db5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1CaveESUCdA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking to the publisher about Linux support like the first game they told me: "Outside of Windows, we'll have to see whether Mac and Linux players are interested. We'll definitely do Steam Deck though".</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ride your way, every way: Find your own path and attack the mountain in style</li>
<li>Ride solo or multiplayer: Be a lone wolf, or join players all around the world in grinding for those points</li>
<li>Freestyle board controls: Control every subtle movement of your rider, with in-depth physics and trick systems to learn and master</li>
<li>Showcase your skills: Keep and show off your incredible plays - you've got all the tools you need to make the best edits</li>
<li>Build your reputation: A fully-featured character customizer and rep system so you can unlock new threads, gear and boards</li>
<li>Ride to banger after banger: Descend in style to the perfect soundtrack from Monstercat</li>
<li>Become the next Descender: Complete all the challenges the world has to offer, and reach the ranks of the legendary Descenders!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it along on Steam</a> now.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers adds support for HoYo and Nexon launchers, easier EA App repairs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few days ago the great NonSteamLaunchers project, to help you set up various third-party launchers on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, had a new release adding support for even more launchers.</p>
<p>This is a project that can really streamline the process to get launchers installed and added to Steam. It now includes support for the HoYo Launcher (HoYoPlay) and Nexon Launcher as of version 3.9.2. That's in addition to the already supported Amazon Games Launcher, Battle.net, EA App, Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, Rockstar Games Launcher, Ubisoft Connect and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4069179401722962038gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - HoYoPlay</em></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/releases/tag/v3.9.2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Desktop Version:<br/>

<p>Decky Plugin Version (Decky Loader Testing Store):</p>
<p>Added the "Uninstall" button<br/>
Legacy Game Scanner was added</p>

      <title>The Jackbox Megapicker fixed to stop megabreaking your Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What Valve <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/891390/history/?changeid=24585659" rel="noopener" target="_blank">called</a> the "jackbrick megabricker" (ouch), The Jackbox Megapicker should now stop breaking your Steam Deck after the latest update to the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>For those who missed it: recently the team at party game developer Jackbox Games, Inc. released their launcher called The Jackbox Megapicker to bring together all their games and help you get your party started a little easier considering how many they've released now.</p>
<p>However, it came with an issue where it would break your Steam Deck. Valve ended up forcing it to use Proton to get around the issue but now the Jackbox team have released an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828500/view/4368013560344221505" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> that amongst other improvements notes "A small subset of Steam Deck users experienced a boot loop if they restarted their Steam Deck after launching The Jackbox Megapicker.

      <title>Pull off sick tricks and take down hordes of demons in Motordoom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Motordoom is the latest entry in the survivor-like horde shooter genre popularised by Vampire Survivors, and this one has you do some freestyle-sports.</p>
<p>Quite a unique combination this one. Take down monsters with various weapons and abilities while performing tricks. All the usual mechanics you would expect in such a horde shooter with lots and lots of upgrades to make every run just that little bit different. Here you also get to earn experience by combining trick combos with kills!</p>
<p>It's a really cool idea, and I did quite enjoy the demo for Motordoom too. Completely over the top once it gets going. If you love action-packed games that are a bit different it's an easy purchase.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EwWU0nWNOMk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/263f8221c0688d0fec446b8305160d6f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EwWU0nWNOMk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With it now released the developer mentioned they plan to add in a final level and a final boss, more skins, cards, potentially some new characters and they're also working on modding support so that could be really interesting for this one due to the combination of genres.</p>
<p>The developer also released a quick patch recently which fixed up some visual effects in the Linux version.</p>
<p>Available with Native Linux <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894720/Motordoom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support on Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>You play as Ines, a 19-year-old (yes, she's older now!) aspiring writer. Hoping to find peace and inspiration for her second novel, she's about to spend a few weeks in [redacted], her uncle Lee's hometown.

      <title>Chocolate Doom 3.1.0 brings many new features for the classic source port</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While other source ports are pretty popular like GZDoom, Chocolate Doom continues getting better to retain the best compatibility with the original DOS versions of Doom, Doom II, Heretic, Hexen and Strife. It's been quite a few years too, with the last main release of Chocolate Doom being back in 2017.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10678958031722936866gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the new features included in Chocolate Doom v3.1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>WAD file autoloading was added - WAD and DEH files can be copied into an autoload folder to be automatically included on every game start.</li>
<li>MP3 music packs are now supported.</li>
<li>Network synchronization now uses a PID controller by default, which makes games more smooth and more stable, especially for Internet play.</li>
<li>UDP hole punching is now used to make servers behind NAT gateways.<br/>
automatically accessible to the Internet.</li>
<li>The IWAD files installed by Steam on Linux are now detected.</li>
<li>The Freedoom single-player IWAD files are now officially supported, since recent versions changed all levels to be vanilla compatible.</li>
<li>Add improved gamepad support via the SDL_GameController interface. This includes support for analog triggers, modern dual-stick default bindings (based on Unity Doom), descriptive button names for common controller types and configurable dead zones for stick axes.</li>
<li>Doom 1.2 demo support was added.</li>
<li>+ lots and lots more.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Manjaro Linux gets an Immutable version available for testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Manjaro Linux team have announced the first round of testing for their new Manjaro Immutable version of the popular Linux distribution.</p>
<p>It's built using <a href="https://github.com/arkanelinux/arkdep" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arkdep</a> which is a "Toolkit for building, deploying and maintaining an immutable, atomic, btrfs-based system". Along with also using <a href="https://arkanelinux.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arkane Linux</a> a "opinionated, immutable, atomic Arch-based distibution".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2419030641722936205gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of this release is to gather community feedback on the technology powering Manjaro Immutable.</p>
<p>Note that this is only an experimental release and not representative of the final version, there is also no support guarantee, so hold off on installing it as your primary operating system, at least for now.</p>
<cite>Manjaro Team</cite></blockquote>
<p>It's probable this is what they're using as the basis for Manjaro Gaming Edition, which is what will be shipping on their upcoming <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/manjaro-linux-devs-show-off-the-orangepi-neo-prototype-handheld-with-gameplay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Orange Pi Neo gaming handheld</a>. In fact, Manjaro's own Philip Müller commented to <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/manjaro-immutable-out-now-for-community-testing/166364/25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mention</a> how it's "useful if you have devices like a gaming handheld or a business which wants to ease the maintenance efforts of their employees".</p>
<p>Another developer also <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/manjaro-immutable-out-now-for-community-testing/166364/40" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> this is <em>not</em> intended to replace the standard Manjaro.</p>
<p>Anyone brave enough to give it a spin can see more details in <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/manjaro-immutable-out-now-for-community-testing/166364" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 42: Upset the Applecart</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p></p>
<p>While the studio's destiny would later see it become consumed by Microsoft, in its earliest days Bungie instead stayed a Mac focused development house, whose <em>Marathon</em> games were for a time kept exclusive to that platform. Starting with the release of <em>Myth: The Fallen Lords</em> in 1997 they switched to cross-platform development, which soon caught the attention of a fledgling Loki Software. With the sequel, Bungie would again cater to an underrepresented video game market.</p>
<p><em>Myth II: Soulblighter</em> is set sixty years after the events of the original game, and while the plot can be said to be standalone, the lore makes heavy allusions back to the first game. One of the issues of the porting model is that you often only get fragments of a larger series, and I think my appreciation here did suffer from this. <em>Myth</em> also gets touted as being an RTS without the tedious resource gathering and base building, but I have always found combat micromanagement to be the least engaging aspect.</p>
<p>Along with its exclusive focus on commanding a pre-defined arrangement of troops into battle, the <em>Myth</em> series also innovated by being a very early example of a 3D real-time strategy title. <em>Myth II</em> in particular iterated on this by emphasizing the effects of weather and environmental conditions on combat, with fire and explosives being doused by water and higher elevations giving archers greater advantage when shooting arrows. Ranged units also seem especially prone to friendly fire.</p>
<p>Other games had taught me to keep my melee fighters in front to soak up and block attacks, but in <em>Myth II</em> this will prevent your archers and dwarves from making their shots, with them often firing into your own ranks. Instead, you need to keep your melee combatants out of the direct line of fire but still nearby, in order to mob the enemy as soon as they close the distance. Keeping a good handle on your dwarves in particular is half the battle, as they do not discriminate when hurling their bombs.</p>
<p>You get tasked with babysitting the AI, which feeds into the game as a whole feeling kind of contrived. The maps while detailed are kept small due to the demands of the 3D engine, and your objectives are static and rigid, causing me to chafe at how stage managed the game can be. I can see why people do love <em>Myth II</em>, as its narrow focus and tight encounter design does offer the potential for someone to attain total mastery, but for me I have to admit it felt a chore playing it through to the end.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1302424911722882898gol6.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1302424911722882898gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19004533261722882900gol6.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19004533261722882900gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>On a technical level the Linux port by Loki both installed and ran well for me, but 3D acceleration was always a sticking point. <em>Myth II: Soulblighter</em> was developed with 3dfx Glide in mind, and out of the box that is the only 3D API that the game supports outside of software rendering. OpenGL support was included in a later patch, still available through the Loki Update tool, but on my hardware and with my drivers I actually found that the software renderer looked and performed better.</p>
<p>Later patches also provide support for <em>Myth II: Chimera</em>, an eight level expansion developed by fans with the participation of Bungie. To get this to work I used the chimera-1.0.run installer which will add the new levels to the mission selection screen, which are of a high quality only let down by some amateurish presentation; the new voice acting is flat when compared to the excellent narration of the base game, but even there, some of the more incidental voices could still be rather silly.</p>
<p>The greatest flourish in <em>Myth II</em> are the animated cutscenes, a nice little time capsule of a style of adult animation that has since fallen out of favour, reminding me of shows like the contemporary <em>Spawn</em> animated series of the time. Another fine touch is the game allowing you to record demos of your battles in order to play them back again later, even if it does further emphasize the preformative nature of the scenarios. If you really want to show off your perfect run, this is the way to do it.</p>
<p>These demos can even be ran easily on newer computers thanks to Project Magma, another fan effort similar to the OldUnreal project that maintains a modern branch of the <em>Myth II</em> engine with the full blessing of Bungie. The graphical installer provided on the Project Magma website will read the data off either a Linux or a Windows and Mac CD-ROM of the game, both of which are still easy to find second hand even today; only the Linux version of <em>Quake III Arena</em> shows up more often on eBay.</p>
<p>It also offers a great option for those who still want to engage with <em>Myth II</em> multiplayer, a feature very much advertised on the box that I may want to try myself now that I have gotten a handle on the mechanics. I enjoyed using the The Deceiver's magic to convert the dark forces over to my side, so being able to play as them in multiplayer might make for a refreshing change. But for now, I might just outdo myself by covering perhaps the most obscure Linux developer I have written about to date.</p>

      <title>FNA gets Direct3D 11 support on Linux thanks to DXVK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Ethan Lee yesterday announced the release of FNA 24.08, bringing with it preparation for the upcoming release of SDL 3 and a fun addition of Direct3D 11 support on Linux thanks to DXVK.</p>
<p>What is FNA? It's a reimplementation of the Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4.0 Refresh libraries. Quite a lot of games use it since it's open source and cross-platform. Games using it includes the likes of Streets of Rage 4, Terraria, Unrailed!, Axiom Verge 1 &amp; 2 and the list <a href="http://www.flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=Portfolio/Tools#01_FNA.txt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">goes on</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/fna-direct3d-11-support-on-linux-using-dxvk-and-vkd3d/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FNA release 23.05</a> from last year pulled in the early initial Alpha of Direct3D 11 support on Linux, with FNA 24.08 now making it properly official. The DXVK project itself merged in the DXVK-Native code way back in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/vulkan-based-d3d9-10-and-11-translation-layer-dxvk-version-20-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DXVK 2.0 at the end of 2022</a>. What's the point of it? Even easier game porting, with it translating Microsoft's D3D API to Vulkan for Native Linux games.</p>
<p>Speaking about the release, Lee said in the FNA <a href="https://discord.gg/fna-xna" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discord</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big surprise, it's another release that's mostly SDL3 prep and not much else. But don't be fooled, this month was huge for FNA - for SDL 3.0 the maintainers have decided to go with our GPU API, and we've even been cleared to try and get it into the first release! We've been focused entirely on GPU since then, and progress continues - we're hoping to have the API in Beta very very soon, barring any oddities from D3D12.</p>
<p>At the same time, FNA's D3D11 support on Linux is now officially complete and supported! Steam developers are encouraged to request the "Sniper" runtime for their native Linux versions, so users can enable DXVK support if they'd like. I expect our GPU API to be just as good at least, but it's a nice thing to have in the meantime.</p>
<p>It's been a graphics-heavy summer for sure, with way more crunch than any of us would have liked, but the results will definitely be worth it!</p>

      <title>Glorious retro FPS &#39;Selaco&#39; is now Steam Deck Verified and plans many huge gameplay upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As far as retro-styled shooters go, Selaco is probably <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/selaco-is-now-in-early-access-one-of-the-best-shooters-ive-played-in-forever/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one of the best I've ever played</a>. With chunky visuals, fun combat and some really nice level design. Now, it's Steam Deck Verified and we have a better idea of what's to come next.</p>
<p>Valve has now given it the glorious green <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified tick of approval, with their Native Linux version as of July 31st. So you can now hopefully be sure that you can take it on the go, and carry on with it on your desktop whenever you want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8514387681722602422gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8514387681722602422gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for what's to come next? They have pretty exciting plans, although they're not going to give us any dates on when to expect them. Posted in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4374768959778727710" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developer update</a> on Steam here's some of what's coming in the <em>next </em>update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Backpack Reloading - This was a frequently requested feature. This is a system where, after not equipping a weapon for a while, the weapon will be automatically reloaded with a full magazine (provided there is enough ammo for it). This ensures that players will always swap to a loaded weapon in the middle of combat. This system is optional and can be disabled.</li>
<li>Improved Immersion &amp; Interactivity - The next update adds brand new visual and audio effects, improves rain to look more atmospheric, adds new interactables and more. If you like a world that feels believable and reactive, you will love some of these changes.</li>
<li>Weapon Rebalancing - Another round of weapon balancing! This also includes making automatic weapons more consistent with their damage output. The current version on Steam has an oversight where there is a solid chance to roll low damage numbers consecutively, making some automatic weapons feel weaker than they are meant to be.</li>
<li>Stagger improvements - Currently, enemies are less likely to stagger the higher your difficulty is. This ended up being a bad idea because it makes certain weapons lose their usefulness. The next update will address this and compensate with something more reasonable.</li>
<li>Another round of performance improvements - A large amount of code is being optimized to reduce the amount of strain on your hardware, resulting in smoother frames and less hiccups.</li>
<li>A slew of other Quality of Life Improvements - Vastly improved Grenade Throwing, new Map Icons, a DMR that respects your Hold/Toggle setting and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more than that, although the below content is likely to be a fair bit later. They're only a small team, and the game has a lot in it already, so they do have plenty of time to get this right. Still, I can't help but be excited by plenty of their future plans that include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Story Content - This is the big one. Selaco will get a major voice-over pass to flesh out Dawn as a character, the world of Selaco and the general plot. We unfortunately ran out of time to do this at launch, which made certain parts of the game feel more empty than we'd like. <em>This is planned to arrive around the end of the year.</em></li>
<li>Randomizer Mode - Another big feature is the Randomizer Mode. This aims to add tons of replayability to the game. It randomizes enemy spawns, introduces a Rarity System where some weapons and enemies are more powerful than usual, repositions ammo pickups and offers tons of customization to tweak the game to your liking.<em> This mode is planned to launch alongside the Story Content update.</em></li>
<li>Improved enemy tacticsI - Better Patrol modes, a goal system, cover system and more are planned for our AI. These will take a while, though, and may not appear until Chapter 2. Please bear with us as we give them an additional boost in intelligence!</li>
<li>Adjustable difficulty during the campaign - We are looking into a system that allows players to drop the difficulty at any time during a campaign playthrough. We wanted to add this earlier, but it was quite a complicated problem to tackle and will need a bit more time.</li>
<li>Customizable Mutators - We are working on a system that allows players to customize individual mutators before starting a new campaign. For example, tweak Hard-Boiled Mode to disable the additional projectile speed for the enemy, or play Hardcore Mode but with standard Weapon Reload behavior. <em>Mutators that have been customized will show an apostrophe symbol at the Chapter Completion Screen</em></li>
<li>Improved Safe Rooms - We are working on additional features to make Safe Rooms more interesting and useful. This includes a free one-time use Health Cache where players can refill their health, and an Armor Station where players can purchase armor. However, the latter might not appear until Chapter 2.</li>
<li>Chapter 2 is coming along nicely - Chapter 2 introduces a large amount of new systems which we will talk about in a blog post closer to its launch.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
